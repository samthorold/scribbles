## Risk appetite and risk efficiency

Different stakeholders will have different risk appetites.

Risk appetite will also vary within a class of stakeholders, e.g. dependent on features of a particular individual or company.

Appetite may be related to

- Existing exposure to risk
- Culture of the individual / company

Sufficient capital is needed if a risk is to be retained.

Individuals rarely have sufficient capital to absorb the consequences of a risk event occurring.

The fact that different stakeholders have different appetites for risk enables risk to be transferred between different entities in exchange for a monetary payment.

Where there is a good market for risk transfer, the system is said to be risk efficient.

### Risk appetite of different stakeholders

As introduced in the earlier chapter, risk appetite can be broadly defined as being a statement of the maximum amount and types of risk that an individual or organisation is prepared to take on, in order to meet their objectives.

Different stakeholders will have different appetites for risk ...

... and even within a particular class of stakeholder there will be different appetites for risk.

For example, one individual may have a speculative attitude to market risk, while another might be highly cautious.

The speculative individual will prefer investing in emerging markets or highly geared funds ...

... while the cautious individual would avoid any equity investment at all.

Corporate entities also have different appetites for risk.

Frequently the risk appetite is described in public documents, such as the company's annual report.

For a corporation, the risk appetite needs to be set by the board and then communicated clearly throughout the organisation.

Although the published statements of risk appetite may be unquantified, most organisations, and particularly those in the financial sector, should quantify their risk appetite so that it is a measurable item that can be included in monthly or quarterly management information packs.

For a provider of schemes providing benefits on future contingent events, a quantifiable risk appetite might be that the organisation will not accept risks that would cause its available capital to fall below x% of the regulatory minimum capital requirement (where x might be 150 or 200, for example).

Other examples for a company might be;

- that the probability of a credit rating downgrade over the next twelve months should be less than 1%
- that profit volatility over the next twelve months should be no more than y%.

Risk appetite may be linked to other features of the individual or company, such as their existing exposure to a particular risk, but it may also be a feature of the culture of the company or the type of individual.

## Risk and product design

Insurance products are prime examples of a means by which one party transfers risk to another party, for a cash payment which needs to cover the cost of the risk plus profit.

Collective investment schemes allow individuals to transfer the risk of making poor investment decisions due to lack of expertise or lack of time to perform research.

All risks involved in a product should be identified during the product design process, and mitigation techniques considered.

It may be possible to hedge risks across different product types (e.g. immediate annuities and whole life assurances).

To deteremine an appropriate cost for a particular policy, risks should be classified into subgroups, each of which represents a homogenous body of risk with a particular set of rating factors.

There is a risk that a product design will not meet beneficiaries' needs and desires.

This can be addressed through market research and trials.

Additional options may make a product more attractive, but also introduce new
risks and therefore additional cost.

## Insurable risk

- Policyholder has an interest in the risk
- Risk is of a financial and reasonably quantifiable nature
- Claim amount payable has some relationship to the financial loss

Additional criteria

- Individual risks should be independent
- Probability of risk occurring should be relatively small
- Large numbers of risks should be pooled to reduce variance
- There should be a limit on ultimate liability undertaken
- Moral hazard should be eliminated as far as possible
- There should be sufficient existing data / information to quantify the risk

## Pooling risk

Insureres and reinsurers take on risks in return for a premium because in doing
so they can combine or pool many risks together.

This means that te law of large numbers takes effect, which implies that actual
results are increasingly likely to be close to expected results, which results
in greater certainty (lower volatility) for the insurer.

Through the assessment and control of risk, actuaries create opportunities for
insurance companies to make profit by accepting risk.
