Amounts set aside to meet future liabilities.

The value placed on provisions is highly dependent on the assumptions used
which will be highly dependent on the reasons for calculating the provisions.

## Calculating individual provisions

Reasons for calculating individual provisions

- Determine value of liabs for published accounts
- Demonstrate supervisory solvency
- Determine value of liabs for internal management accounts
- Value the provider for merger or acquisition (or transfer liabs)
- Determine whether discretionary benefits can be awarded
- Setting future contribution levels for a benefit scheme
- Valuing benefit improvements for a pension scheme
- Calculating discontinuance benefits
- Influencing investment strategy
- Provide disclosure information to beneficiaries

## Calculating global provisions

Needed for

- Additional protection against insolvency
- Cover risks, financial and non-financial, that cannot necessarily be
attributed to individual contracts
- Reflect the degree of mismatching of assets and liabilities

Provider's risk management startegy is an important influence on provision
for risks.

## Different bases

The bases in order of increasing strength are

- Optimistic
- Best estimate
- Cautious

A best estimate basis is a basis with an equal probability of overstating
or understating values.

## Choice of basis and valuation method

- Reason for valuation
- Needs of the client
- Regulation and legislation

Nature of assets is important when valuing liabilities.

## Setting assumptions with regard to purpose

- Published accounts: legislation and accounting principles
    - Going-concern or break-up
    - Reflecting a true and fair value
    - Best estimate vs prudent
- Supervisory solvency: consider the degree of prudence and any prescribed
methods / assumptions vs actuarial judgement with disclosure requirement
- Internal accounts: best estimate
- Liability transfers: BE basis used to value liabs to be fair to all
parties and achieve agreement from actuaries acting for either party.
Different basis might be used
    - Due to a power imbalance between the parties
    - Stronger desire to proceed by one of the parties
    - Recognise the need to hold margins to protect security
- Determine whether discretionary benefits can be awarded: Likely cautious
so surplus is not over-stated
- Setting contribution levels: assumptions used will depend on the objectives
of the parties concerned and on the structure of the membership.
- Calculating discontinuance benefits: BE probably
- Setting investment strategy: realistic set of assumptions based on
sensitivity and scenario testing.
A stochastic approach can add significant value.
- Disclosure information for beneficiaries: assumptions will reflect
legislation but a realistic basis will typically be used with a range
of results also provided.

## Setting assumptions with regards to the client

Different clients have different

- Purposes
- Risk appetite
- Interactions with other stakeholders

## Setting assumptions with regards to prudence

- purpose of the valuation
- objectives of the client
- regulation
- chars of the scheme
    - size
    - maturity
    - funding level
- degree of certainty in the assumptions
- financial significance of the assumptions
- tax

Ultimately, the level of prudence does not determine the actual cost of the pension scheme.
This is only known when all liabilities have been extinguished.

However, for a funding valuation, the assumptions determine the contribution rate
and so the pace at which funds are built up.
