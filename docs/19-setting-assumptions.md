## Assumptions

All actuarial models need assumptions.
Factors affecting the choice of assumptions

- Use of model
- Financial significance of the assumptions
- Consistency between assumptions
- Legislative and regulatory requirements
- Needs of the client

## Historic and current data

Sources of historic and current data

- Internal
- National statistics
- Industry
- Actuarial tables
- Reinsurers

Data may not be immediately relevant to future experience.
Must consider if social and economic conditions will apply in the future.
If so, how will they be different?
There is a trade-off between credibility and having sufficient data.

Consider

- Abonormal fluctuations (and one-off impacts)
- Changes in experience with time
- Random fluctuations
- Changes in the way in which data has been removed
- Potential errors in the data
- Changes in the mix of homogeneous groups within past data
- Changes in the mix of homogeneous groups to which assumptions apply

Current, and not just historic, data can be a good predictor of the future

- Statements by governments or central banks
- Industry forecasts
- Views of company directors
- Current yields on fixed-interest and index-linked bonds is a good indicator
of future expected inflation
