## Pure endowment and endowment assurance

Pure endowment provides a benefit on survival to a known date
and so operates as a savings vehicle.
For example, to provide a lump sum on retirement,
or a means of repaying a loan.

Endowment assurance also provides a significant benefit on the death before
the date and so operates as a vehicle for providing protection for
dependents.

## Whole life assurance

Provides a benefit on death whenever that might occur.

## Term assurance

Provides a benefit on death provided it occurs within the date.
Do not normally have any benefit on withdrawal.

## Convertible or renewable term assurance

Combine a term assurance with the certainty of being able either to convert
to a permanent form of contract (endowment or whole life assurance) or to
renew the original contract for a further period, all without further
evidence of health being provided (unless the level of benefit is increased).

## Immediate annuity

A single premium purchasing an income stream which commences immediately
after purchase.

## Deferred annuity

Can be used when there is time between the date of purchase and the date when
the income is required to start (vesting date).
The contract can be paid for either by a single premium of by regular premiums
during the deferred period.

## Income drawdown

Leave the accumulated pension fund at retirement invested and draw an income
from it each year.
There may be limits on how much can be drawn down each year and an age limit
at which point an annuity must be purchased.

## Investment bond

Single premium invested for the whole life or a fixed term.
Benefit depends on investment returns during the period of investment.
Funds can be withdrawn but this may incur surrender penalties,
particularly at early durations.
There may be a guarantee offered on death.

## Income protection insurance

Enables individuals to provide an income for themselves and their
dependents during periods of long-term sickness or incapacity due to
accident or illness.
Such contracts typically terminate at retirement age.

## Critical illness insurance

Lump sum on diagnosis of a critical illness as defined by the policy
documents.

## Keyperson cover

either home or nursing home care as an elderly persion i.e. post
retirement.
