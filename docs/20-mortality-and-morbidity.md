## Risk classification

Providers use rating factors to to identify the characteristics of the risks
they underwrite, and to pool risks ito homogeneous groups.

All risks in a group can be charged the same premium.

Anti-selection can arise when heterogeneity exists in a group of risks.

## Factors contributing to variations in mortality and morbidity

- Sex
- Heterogeneity within groups
- Occupation
- Nutrition
- Housing
- Climate / geography
- Education
- Genetics

The above risks become less significant in old age, leading to mortality
convergence.

## Selection

The process by which lives in a population are divided into separate
homogeneous groups.

- Temporary initial selection: level of risk increases or decreases since the
selection process (or discriminating event).
- Class selection: a select group is taken from a population consisting of a
mixture of classes. of individuals with different characteristics.
- Time selection: select group is taken from a population of individuals from
different calendar years.
- Adverse selection: individual's choice influences the selection process.
- Spurious selection: distorting effect of a confounding factorgives the
false impression that one of the other forms of selection is present.

These examples apply to insurance and pensions.

Inaccurately classifying risks means insurers cannot charge correct premiums
reflecting the underlying risk.
They will be exposed to adverse selection because of the differences in
premiums charged by competitors.
Different mortality tables for different classes of individuals (heterogeneity).

## Decrements and a selective effect

A selective decrement will select from the population lives whose rate of
decrement from another cause differs from that of the population.
