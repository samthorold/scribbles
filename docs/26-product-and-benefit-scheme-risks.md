## Risks and uncertainties

Relate to both contributions / premiums and benefits.

Risks to beneficiary

- Benefits are less valuable than expected / required
- Benefits not received at the expected / required time

Risks to the provider

- Benefits greater than expected
- Benefits required at an inopportune time

The state is at risk of having to cover benefits private companies fail to meet.

## Benefit risks

For benefits that are _known_, the risk is that assets are not sufficient to
meet liabilities as they fall due.

- Underfunding
- Insolvency of sponsor / provider
- Asset - liability mismatching
- Change in benefit promise (by provider or state)
- Beneficiaries' needs not being met e.g. misunderstanding, inflation erosion,
changed circumstances

For benefits that are _not known_

- Investment returns being lower than expected
- Expense charges being higher than expected
- Annuity purchase terms being poorer than expected (e.g. DC scheme)
- Beneficiaries' needs not being met e.g. misunderstanding, inflation erosion,
changed circumstances

For both cases

- Default of sponsor / provider
- Failure of sponsor / provider to pay conts / premiums in a timely manner
- Takeover of sponsor / provider
- Decision of sponsor / provider to reduce benefits
- Inadequate communication by sponsor / provider with beneficiaries
- General economic mismanagement of assets and liabilities by sponsor / provider

## Contribution / premium risks

_Known_ in advance

- Conts / prems not affordable and so not met
- Insufficient liquidity to make payments in a timely manner
- Conts / prems linked to an inflationary factor, reducing the risk they
increase morew rapidly than expected
- Conts / prems are not linked to inflation so the value is eroded

_Not known_ in advance - **cost and conts / prems will likely be different**.
Future conts / prems will depend on

- Amount of promised benefit
- Probability of individuals being eligible to accrue benefits
- Probability of individuals being able to receive benefits
- Effect of inflation on the level, real level, of the benefits
- Investment return (net of tax) on conts / prems

If there is a shortfall in a defined benefit scheme, the sponsor may be
required by legislation to make extra conts. Associated risks include

- Lack of liquid funds
- Excessive conts, which the sponsor may not be able to afford

Further risks include

- Takeover of the sponsor and they are not willing to continue conts
- Extra costs through the provision of guarantees
- Loss of funds due to fraud or misappropriation
- Incorrect benefit payments
- Inappropriate advice
- Administrative costs e.g. comply with changes in legislation
- Decisions by parties to whom power has delegated
- Fines or removal of tax status for non-compliance with legislation
- Changes due to tax rates or status

## Overall security

- Investment risk
- Model, parameter, and data risks
- Strength and security of the sponsor / provider

## Business risks for financial product providers

- Claims
    - Mortality
    - Longevity
    - Morbidity
    - General insurance claim rates and amounts
- Expenses
- Withdrawals / renewals
- New business volume and mix
- Options and guarantees
- Use of reinsurance (insurance company) or insurance (benefit scheme)
