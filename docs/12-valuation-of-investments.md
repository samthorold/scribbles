## Valuation methods for individual investments

Trend towards market value. Common methods include;

- (Historic) book value
- Written up/down book value
- Market value
- Smoothed market value
- Fair value
- Discounted cashflow
- Stochastic modelling
- Arbitrage value

The fair value of an asset is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged
or a liability settled between _knowledgeable_, _willing_ parties in an arm's
length transaction.

## Market values vs calculated values

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Objective | May not be quoted |
| Realistic as realisable value on sale (assuming bid price used) | Volatile, even in short-term |
| No calculation | May not reflect value of future proceeds |
| Understood and accepted | Must decide in bid, mid, or offer price |
| Can be used as a comparison to other methods to see if an asset is over/under priced | Difficult to ensure consistency of basis with liability valuation |
| | Value reflects position of marginal investor rather than individual e.g. tax situation |
| | May not be realisable value on sale if dealing in large volumes or illiquid stocks |

Using a value other than market implies taking a view as to where the market is
going.

Under such circumstances,
the actuary must ensure the client understands the implications,
especially with respect to short-term solvency.

## Bonds

Discounted value of coupons and redemption.

Discount rate should reflect the riskiness of the payment and the marketability
of the bond,

## Equities

Starting point is usual market value.
