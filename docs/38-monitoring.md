## Reasons for monitoring experience

Monitoring the experience is a fundamental part of the actuarial control cycle.
The experience will be monitored to

- Update the method and assumptions so that they are more relevant to future
experience
- Monitor any trends in experience, particularly adverse, to take corrective
actions
- Provide management (and other key stakeholder) information

## Data required for monitoring

Basic req: reasonable volume of stable, consistent data, from which future
experience and trends can be deduced.

Data ideally needs to be divided into sufficiently homogeneous risk groups,
according to relevant risk factors.

But, this ideal has to be balanced against the danger of creating groups
that have too little data to be credible.

As well as data on the feature being assessed,
it is necessary to have data on the exposed to risk,
divided into the same group structure as the experience data.

## Analysis process

For statistical factors such as mortality and withdrawal,
this will include the calculation for each age band of the number of deaths
/ withdrawals divided by the number exposed to risk of death / withdrawal.

The results can then be compared with assumptions or standard tables,
where they exist.

For economic factors such as interest rates and investment returns,
the analysis is simply a comparison between the actual returns and
those assumed.

Other economic factors include expense inflation and salary growth.
Expenses were covered earlier.
A salary growth analysis is likely to distinguish between general inflation
related salary increases and promotional salary increases.

## Use of results

Results of an analysis of experience should not be used blindly.
Consider

- Is the period typical?
- Is the period likely to be representative of the future?

_Perhaps referring to: a big regulatory change is not typical,
but is representative of the future?_

Allow for

- Trends: incl gradual changes
- Cycles
- Abnormal events
- Random fluctuations

Before being used as assumptions,
results from an experience analysis should be adjusted for data and modelling
risk.

## Monitoring and control cycles

Monitoring of experience is fundamental to effective implementation of the
actuarial control cycle and the risk management control cycle.

Iterative process because it may result in changes in

- Assumptions or models e.g. pricing, setting conts, and provisioning
- Assessment of the risks faced by a provider or in risk management strategy.
