## Risk classification

Apart from the variation in mortality rates between the sexes and between different ages ...

... mortality rates vary both within a population and between different populations ...

... as a result of a number of other risk factors, ie influences that affect the mortality of individuals.

Morbidity rates will also vary.

---

Providers use rating factors to to identify the characteristics of the risks they underwrite ...

... and to pool risks ito homogeneous groups.

All risks in a group can be charged the same premium.

Anti-selection can arise when heterogeneity exists in a group of risks.

## Risk classification in life insurance

### Heterogeneity

The providers of financial products offer cover against risk events.

Individuals or companies buying these products all have different features ...

... no two people in the world are alike in every respect, not even identical twins.

??? note

    A product provider could assess each individual or company ...

    ... and determine the premium to charge and the cover to provide for each risk it considers.

    This approach works when the risks are rare and large and it is very difficult to group them.

    Marine hull and cargo covers are a good example ...

    - ... not only are ships generally different from each other ...
    - ... but the cargos they carry and the routes they travel accentuate the differences.
    - It is appropriate and practical to assess each risk individually.

Normally, risks are small and individual assessment would be prohibitively expensive.

For these risks the provider usually has access to a large amount of data concerning how the population behaves.

If the population can be **divided into relatively homogeneous groups** ...

... a price can be determined that applies to all risks in that group.

If a product provider can ***pool independent homogeneous risks*** ...

... then as a result of the Central Limit Theorem ...

... the profit per policy will be a random variable that follows the normal distribution ...

... with a known mean and standard deviation.

The company can use this result to set **premium rates** ...

... which ensure that the probability of a loss on a portfolio of policies is at an acceptable level.

The process by which potential insured lives are separated into different homogeneous groups for premium rating purposes, according to the risk they present, is called **risk classification**.

It involves trying to identify any risk factors specific to the individual that might influence the likely risk of that individual.

### Selection

Selection (sometimes called anti-selection or adverse selection) is taking advantage of inefficiencies in a provider’s pricing basis to secure better terms than might otherwise be justified ...

... normally at the expense of the product provider.

Selection is not a fraudulent, immoral, or illegal activity.

In other words, adverse selection can occur when a person buys a policy that they believe is a "good deal" (and therefore a "bad deal" for the provider). 

Policyholders with worse than average experience will be more likely to take out the contract.

#### Examples of anit-selection for LI

People who smoke will tend to seek life assurance from companies that charge identical premiums for smokers and non-smokers ...

... whereas non-smokers will apply to companies that differentiate between them ...

... and therefore charge cheaper premiums to non-smokers.

The first company will suffer from adverse selection, as the ratio of smoker to non-smoker lives that it takes on will increase.

Selective withdrawal (of healthy lives) worsens the company’s average mortality experience from those policies that remain.

### Risk Grouping

**Careful underwriting** is the mechanism by which a provider ensures that its risk groups are homogeneous.

The risk groups are defined using **rating factors**, e.g.

- age
- gender
- medical history
- height / weight
- lifestyle.

In theory, a provider should continue to add rating factors to its underwriting system ...

... until the differences in risk between the different categories of the next rating factor are indistinguishable from ...

... the random variation between risks that remains after using the current list of rating factors.

Both the ability of prospective policyholders to provide accurate responses to questions ...

... and the cost of collecting information limit the extent to which rating factors can be used.

In general a proposal form should not ask for information which requires specialist knowledge.

For example, the cost of undertaking extensive blood tests has to be weighed against ...

... the expected cost of mortality or morbidity claims that will be "saved" as a result of having this information.

## Different mortality tables for different classes of lives

[2019 April Paper 1 Q8-i](40-2019-04-01.md#8-i)

When a life table is constructed it is assumed to reflect the mortality experience of a homogeneous group of lives ...

... i.e. all the lives to whom the table applies follow the same stochastic model of mortality represented by the rates in the table.

This means that the table can be used to model the mortality experience of a homogeneous group of lives which is suspected to have a similar experience.

If a life table is constructed for a heterogeneous group ...

... then the mortality experience will depend on the exact mixture of lives with different experiences that has been used to construct the table.

Such a table could only be used to model mortality in a group with the same mixture.

It would have very restricted uses.

For this reason, separate mortality tables are usually constructed for groups which are expected to be heterogeneous ...

... for example separate tables for males and females.

Sometimes only parts of the mortality experience are heterogeneous ...

... (eg the experience during the initial select period for life assurance policyholders) ...

... and the remainder are homogeneous ...

... (eg the experience after the end of the select period for life assurance policyholders).

In such cases the tables are separate (different) during the select period, but combined after the end of the select period.

The "select period" is the time horizon beyond which we assume no significant difference in mortality between two types of lives.

*A life insurance company wants to construct its own mortality tables and is considering how many data groupings to use.*

*(i) Describe the risk to the company of using one mortality table for all classes of lives together.*

If the life insurer is using the same mortality table for all classes of lives together ...

... it will be charging the same premium to lives which present different risks.

The premium will be based on the average risk.

This practice leaves the company in a risky position because it could easily lose the low risk lives to a competitor who charges differential premium rates.

High risks will be attracted to the company and it will be selected against.


*(ii) Describe the problem with producing tables for different classes of lives.*

The problem with producing tables for different classes of lives is that whilst we would wish to subdivide the data into homogeneous groups as far as possible ...

... we cannot reduce the size of each group below the level at which observations may be statistically significant.

It is also administratively inconvenient to use too many different tables.

## Factors contributing to variations in mortality and morbidity

[2019 April Paper 1 Q8-ii](40-2019-04-01.md#8-ii)

- Sex
    - Female mortality tends to be lower than male mortality.
    - Females are less likely to undertake hazardous pursuits.
    - Susceptibility to certain illnesses varies by gender.
    - Genetic effects can vary by gender.
- Age
    - There is an accident hump from the late teens to mid 20s.
    - As the body ages, individuals are more prone to diseases.
    - Genetic effects may be greater at older ages.

And

- geography
    - country
    - regions
    - urban / rural
- social class
    - manual / non-manual workers
- time
    - mortality rates usual decrease with time

Which are proxies for the "true" factors ... **NB bookwork on each** ...

- Heterogeneity within groups
- **Occupation**
- Nutrition
- Housing
- Climate / geography
- **Education**
- Genetics

The above risks become less significant in old age, leading to mortality
convergence.

It is rare that observed differences in mortality can all be ascribed to a single factor.

It is difficult to disentangle the effects of different factors ...

... because of the relationships between them.

For example, mortality rates of those living in sub-standard housing are (usually) higher than those of people living in good quality housing.

However, those living in sub-standard housing usually have less well-paid occupations and lower educational attainment than those living in good quality housing.

Part or all of the observed difference may be due to these differences and not to housing differences.

It is important for governments to be able to identify risk factors ...

- ... in order to bring about improvements in public health ...
- ... e.g. by means of appropriately targeted public health campaigns.

They are very important in insurance ...

- ... since identifying specific risk factors for an individual enables insurers to classify that individual’s mortality or morbidity risk more precisely ...
- ... thereby allowing more accurate calculation of premiums and reserves.

Most of the factors could be grouped under the general heading "standard of living".

This makes it difficult to isolate the individual effects ...

... since they are correlated with factors ...

... tending to operate together.

However, it is possible by means of statistical studies to identify the dominant risk factors.

So we have two problems.

- First, we want to identify the real factors and not be confused by apparent factors.
- Secondly, we then need to quantify the relative importance of these factors.

## Selection

- Temporary initial selection: level of risk increases or decreases since the
selection process (or discriminating event).
- Class selection: a select group is taken from a population consisting of a
mixture of classes. of individuals with different characteristics.
- Time selection: select group is taken from a population of individuals from
different calendar years.
- Adverse selection: individual's choice influences the selection process.
- Spurious selection: distorting effect of a confounding factorgives the
false impression that one of the other forms of selection is present.

These examples apply to insurance and pensions.

Inaccurately classifying risks means insurers cannot charge correct premiums
reflecting the underlying risk.

They will be exposed to adverse selection because of the differences in
premiums charged by competitors.

Different mortality tables for different classes of individuals (heterogeneity).

## Mortality convergence

In other words, factors such as occupation / social class / geographic area etc have less of an effect on mortality for retired people than they do for people of working age.

## Decrements and a selective effect

A selective decrement will select from the population lives whose rate of
decrement from another cause differs from that of the population.
