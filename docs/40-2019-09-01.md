*A life insurance company has decided to launch a new product in a developing country (Country A) in which it has not operated before.*

*An actuary working for the life insurance company is carrying out an assessment of life expectancy in Country A for the purposes of projecting future liabilities.*

*The actuary is considering using past data from the country’s statistical authority as a basis for their initial work.*

*Outline the factors the actuary should take into account when using this data.*

[Data](18-data.md)

### Credibility

There needs to be a sufficient volume of data.

Need to consider how long the data has been collected for ...

... it may not be many years in a developing country.

### Completeness and quality

Need to consider whether the data is complete and ...

... whether and ...

... how to check for errors.

Need to ensure that all deaths have been included ...

... e.g. whether deaths in rural areas have been included.

Consider whether the data is detailed enough for the analysis ...

... e.g. includes the exposed to risk data as well as information on deaths.

### Relevance

Consider whether the data is relevant ...

... since it relates to the general population ...

... and therefore may not represent the insurer’s target market.

There may have been a change in the mix of homogeneous groups in the population.

Consider whether the past is likely to be a good indicator of the future ...

... for example, might expect to see increases in life expectancy ...

... which could be rapid in a developing country.

Adjustments will need to be made for expected future improvements.

Past data may include abnormal or random fluctuations.

*An established retail bank in a developed country has recently been losing market share. The bank is also facing rising costs from increased rents of its branches and staff salaries.*

*The bank’s Board has decided to become an internet only bank, offering all services online to its retail customers with no physical branches.*

### 2-i

*List the stakeholders who might be affected by such a change.*

- customers
- shareholders
- employees
- competitors
- landlords
- regulators / State

### 2-ii

*The Board of the bank believes that the reduction in costs should increase future profitability and the new model will attract new customers.*

*Describe the risks that might negatively impact the bank’s plans.*

[Risk](risk.md)

#### Customers

Some customers who prefer to use physical branches may leave.

It may be that the customers leaving are older customers ...

... who have larger amounts to invest than average.

Customers who live in rural areas with poor internet connectivity may not be able to stay with the bank.

It may be difficult to attract new customers ...

... as there are no branches to market to them.

The new customers who join may only buy the less profitable products ...

... e.g. take advantage of free current accounts but not take out loans ...

... as they would prefer to use a physical branch for those products.

#### Competitors

If the venture proved a success ...

... then other banks might also make this move and be more successful at it.

Existing online banks may be better at offering products online ...

... and such banks may have a better brand name.

#### Shareholders

There may be insufficient capital in the business to undertake this venture.

The shareholders may not approve of the change in business model ...

... making it difficult to raise funds via a rights issue.

#### Employees

It may be difficult to recruit the specialist IT staff that will be needed.

Operational risk arises if staff training on the new system and processes is inadequate.

The redundancy costs for existing staff may be higher than expected.

Some key existing staff may leave ...

... leading to a lack of knowledge within the business.

Reputational risk arises if customer service is poor due to poorly trained staff. 

#### Regulators

The regulator may not approve the move to becoming an internet only bank.

The regulator may not approve some of the products the bank wishes to sell.

The regulators may not approve the products as quickly as the bank would like.

The regulator may impose additional restrictions for the online business or higher capital requirements. 

#### Landlords

It may not be possible to exit the leases immediately ...

... or to do so may incur a penalty.

#### Other risks

Operational risk may arise if the systems and processes introduced to run the online business prove inadequate.

Cyber risk may arise, e.g. the system could be hacked and data stolen.

#### State

Political risk may arise if the government does not approve of this change.

### 3-i

*State the principles of investment for a provider of benefits on future uncertain events.*

A provider should select investments that are appropriate to the:

- nature
- term
- currency, and
- uncertainty

of the liabilities, and

- the provider’s appetite for risk.

Subject to the above, the investments should also be selected so as to maximise the overall return on the assets, where overall return includes both income and capital.

### 3-ii

*A charity has both short-term and long-term assets. The charity’s fund managers are reviewing their investment strategy.*

*Outline why the charity may need to review the appropriateness of its investment strategy.*

#### Liabilities

The charity’s liabilities may have changed ...

... e.g. more short-term assets required for disaster relief efforts.

The charity’s objectives may have changed ...

... impacting on the future expected liabilities.

#### Financial position

There may have been a change to the level of free assets held ...

... or the cashflow position may have changed ...

... e.g. fewer donations received in the year.

#### Risk appetite

The charity’s risk appetite may have changed.

#### Investment performance

The current investment strategy may have produced low returns compared with the benchmark.

#### External factors

The economic environment may be changing ...

... e.g. moving into a recession.

Regulation may require that a review is carried out.

### 3-iii

*The charity’s long-term assets are invested in an ethical equity fund and an ethical corporate bond fund. The performance of these two funds has been measured and the returns appear to be lower than those of similar funds.*

*Suggest why the performance of the ethical funds might be out of line with similar funds.*

**Compared to similar funds** not vs funds not focussed on ethical investments.

#### Strategies and objectives

The objectives of the other ethical funds may be different.

This will lead to different investment strategies and therefore different returns.

#### Constraints

The other funds may be subject to different constraints, eg:

- how stringent the definition of "ethical" is
- appetite for risk.

The timing of investment and disinvestment may have been unfortunate, eg if the charity disinvested funds just before the funds rose in value.

The other ethical funds may be subject to different constraints, eg:

- ability to invest overseas ...

    ... and therefore exposure to currency risk

- ability to use derivatives
- different fund sizes leading to different investment opportunities.

#### Performance

The charges on this charity’s ethical funds may be higher, reducing the net return.

The investment managers of this charity’s ethical funds may have made poor investment choices.

#### Measurement

Different methods of measurement may have been used by the funds, eg time-weighted rate of return vs money-weighted rate of return.

### 5-ii

*Describe how the company could use capital management tools to reduce the capital requirement in the future.*

### 5-iii

*Discuss possible reasons for these changes in liabilities and solvency capital requirements.*

## 6

*A developed country has introduced legislation which requires the following for corporate governance of boards of insurance companies:*

- *separation of roles of chairman, chief executive, finance director and chief risk officer*
- *the majority of the board to consist of non-executive directors*
- *a director representing employees and pensioners*
- *a minimum of 40% of directors to be male*
- *a minimum of 40% of directors to be female*
- *the regulator must approve all board and senior management appointments.*

*Discuss the appropriateness of the new legislation from the perspective of the main stakeholders.*

### 7-i

*Outline the main factors that influence a financial institution’s long-term investment strategy.*

[Factors influencing an institution's investment strategy](14-choosing-an-appropriate-investment-strategy.md#factors-influencing-an-institutions-investment-strategy)

SOUNDER TRACTORS

### 7-ii

*The board of a university located in a particular city are concerned about the shortage of accommodation available for students. To address this, the board has proposed the construction of a new building which will accommodate approximately 200 students. The new building will be funded by private investors, whose funds will finance the construction and ongoing maintenance of the new building.*

*Outline reasons why private investors would want to invest in the new building.*

[Factors influencing an individual's investment strategy](14-choosing-an-appropriate-investment-strategy.md#factors-influencing-an-individuals-investment-strategy)

Exposure to property asset class

- Diversification.
- Long-term return expected to exceed existing investment portfolio ...
- ... or other potential investments.
- Divisibility.
	- Investing in a property of this size is likely unavailable to most private investors ...
	- ... unless the investment is pooled such as here.
- low level of expertise required from the investors ...
    - domestic asset ...
    - ... likely in the city they live in.

Feel-good factor

- creating accomodation for students ...
- ... who may live more comfortably as a result of the new building

Liability matching

- private investors' liabilities likely to be real and in domestic currency ...
- ... which are well matched by the property investment ...
- ... assuming the investment is repaid using some of the rents received from the students.

### 7-iii

*Contrast how the following potential investors would evaluate this proposal:*

#### 7-iii-a

*A large defined benefit pension scheme.*

Would consider their obligation to provide benefits for members on retirement ...

... and the nature of those liabilities ...

... as well as the level and nature of their existing assets.

Consider whether the investment is allowed under the scheme rules.

Consider whether the investment is allowed under the regulatory regime.

Consider if they are better off investing in property directly ...

... rather than as part of a group of investors ...

... since they probably have the means to not require divisible properties.

Likely have the expertise to invest in property.

#### 7-iii-b

*An individual who has recently inherited a significant sum.*

Would consider their logical vs emotional needs and their current vs future needs.

Logical needs

Current vs Future needs

- what need does the individual have for the cash now ...
- ... and how much does that leave for potential investments.

Potential tax advantages ...

... perhaps there are tax incentives offered by the government for investing in something which helps the university.

Or the investment offers capital gains rather than income ...

... and capital gains.

Consider if they have the expertise to invest in property ...

... or if they require assistance from experts.

### 7-iv

*An alternative proposal being considered by the board is to encourage individual investors to purchase houses in the city to rent out to university students.*

*Assess how this alternative proposal addresses the accommodation shortage.*

Does not create new housing ...

... presumably whoever is moving out of the houses being bought need to live somewhere as well.

Perhaps the student housing shortage will be transformed into a different type of buyer housing shortage.

Not all of the housing will become available at the same time ...

... unlike the new building.

The alternative proposal does not address the accommodation shortage.

## 8

*An insurance company only writes term assurance contracts. The company has been monitoring its mortality experience for many years.*

Term assurance provides a benefit on death provided it occurs within the date. Do not normally have any benefit on withdrawal.

### 8-i

*Describe the reasons for monitoring the mortality experience of these contracts. [4]*

[Monitoring](38-monitoring.md#reasons-for-monitoring-experience)

Monitoring the experience is a fundamental part of the actuarial control cycle.

The experience will be monitored to

- Update the method and assumptions so that they are more relevant to future experience
- Monitor any trends in experience, particularly adverse, to take corrective actions
- Provide management (and other key stakeholder) information

Monitoring can help in:

- updating assumptions
- updating methods ...
- ... to more closely reflect expected future experience.

Trends can be monitored ...

... particularly adverse trends ...

... such as increasing mortality rates ...

... leading to more claims within the term ...

... so corrective action can be taken ...

... eg tighten underwriting procedures.

Monitoring provides information to management ...

... and other key stakeholders.

### 8-ii

*The mortality experience analysis has shown that the company has been underestimating the actual number of deaths that occurred over the last three years.*

*Discuss the reasons why the mortality experience may have been heavier than expected.*

Window used to set mortality assumption inappropriate.

- too long ...
- too short

Error in model used to set assumption.

Data source not representative of the insurance company's policy holders ...

... either a standard table ...

... representing the whole population of a country ...

... or the mix of the insurance companies policyholders has changed.

Insurance company added a new sales channel ...

... altering the mix of policyholders.

External factors.

- mortality improvements not as expected ...
- perhaps due to a pandemic.

Random fluctuations.

### 8-iii

*Describe how the results of this analysis could be used.*

### 8-iv

*The company’s mortality analysis team has raised concerns around selection in relation to these policies.*

*Suggest possible reasons for the selection occurring in these policies.*

Underwriting at proposal stage insufficient ...

... medical underwriting in particular.

Rating factors insufficient to properly rate the risk of policy holders ...

... e.g. not distinguishing between smokers and non-smokers ...

... so they are charged the same premium ...

... and smokers are undercharged while non-smokers are undercharged.

More smokers will buy term assurance contracts from the insurer.
