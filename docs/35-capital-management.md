## Meeting capital needs

Proprietary insurer is owned by shareholders.
So they can issue shares or debt.

Mutual insurer is owned by policyholders to whom all profits belong.
Less access to capital markets but can issue subordinated debt.

Sponsor may be prepared to put up the initial capital for a benefit scheme.
Microinsurance schemes may have support from the state.

Effectiveness of tools depends on the regulatory and tax environment.

### Traditional Reinsurance

- Reduces volatility of claims experience for the firm ...
- reducing the regulatory solvency requirement.
- Contribute to initial capital strain of new business through reinsurance commission.

### Financial reinsurance

- Aim is to exploit some form of regulatory arbitrage to improve capital position.
- Basically, crystallise vakue of future profits.
- Generally, relies on reinsurer being in a different tax / regulatory / solvency regime.
- E.g. loan from reinsurer to firm where repayments are contingent on future profits
arising on a specific block of business e.g. [...]
- Because so liability unless profits emerge, regulator may allow no provision for future
repayments on statutory basis.
- So on regulatory balance sheet, assets increase, liabilities decrease, so funding
position increases.
- Viability reduced under Solvency II...
- Which allows insurer to use future profits as an asset...
- and so expects repayments contingent on future profits to be a liability.

### Securitisation

- Convert an illiquid asset into tradeable instruments e.g. bonds.
- May securitise some of the profits on a block of business.
- This is achieved in practice by selling a bond for cash to the markets by a
special purpose vehicle.
- Repayments (coupons and capital repayment) on bond contingent on future profits emerging
from a block of business.
- As with financial reinsurance, regulator may not require provision for repayments on a
statutory basis.
- As with financial reinsurance, liquidity useful to firm.
- However, complex and non-standard source of finance...
- Requiring more management time and experience to arrange and manage.
- As with financial reinsurance, may be less effective under Solvency II.

### Banking products

- Liquidity facilities e.g. an overdraft could provide short-term financing to help
fund [regulatory changes on new product].
- Contingent capital could be cost-effective method of protecting capital.
- Capital provided as required following deterioration of experience e.g.
[high claims on term assurance].
- But this product lacks visibility.
- Senior unsecured financing if group over-arching company...
- which would allow capital to be raised at the group level then provided to
subsidiaries.
- More cost effective than other forms of capital but has financial strength
implications at the group level.

### Derivatives

- Use derivatives to manage risks and reduce capital requirements.
- E.g. if fall in equity markets a concern for [LI] products...
- can use derivatives to protect equities from falling below a certain level.
- Cost of downside protection can be partially offset by selling some of the upside
via a second derivative.
- Suitability of depends on experience with derivatives.
- Important to exercise caution and not use derivatives for speculation.

### Equity capital

- If propriety firm, can raise additional equity capital.
- Rights issue or new placement of shares.
- Issue of additional shares can dilute holding of existing shareholders...
- potentially negatively impacting share price, if unpopular with investors.

### Internal restructuring

- merging funds
- changing assets - move to closer matched position to reduce market risk
- weakening valuation basis ...
- although regulator will specify type of basis to be used (BE, Solvency II)
- deferring surplus distribution or
- retaining profits ...
- can be viewed negatively by shareholders, potentially so much so that unsuitable.
