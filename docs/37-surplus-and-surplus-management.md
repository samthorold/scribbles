# Ch37: Surplus and Surplus Management

## Definition of surplus / profit

Profit is the difference between revenue and expenditure.
Because of the long-term nature of financial services contracts,
the final profit for a scheme or tranche of policies cannot be determined
until all risks have gone off the books.

Surplus is the difference between the value of the assets and the value of the
liabs.
Surpluses (or deficits) may appear and disappear as the contract's experience
unfolds.

The surplus arising over any time period is the change in the surplus over the
time period.
Surplus arising is equivalent to profit.

## Reasons for performing an analysis of surplus / profit

An analysis of surplus is a breakdown of the surplus arising over the year
into its constituent parts.

A provider will want to analyse surplus arising to

- Show financial effect of divergences between valuation assumps and actual exp
- Determine assumps that are not financially significant
- Show the financial effect of writing new business
- Validate calcs and assumps
- Provide a check on valuation data and process, if carried out independently
- Identify non-recurring components of surplus, to help make decisions about
distributing surplus
- Reconcile values for successive years
- Provide management information
- Provide data for use in executive renumeration schemes
- Provide information for the provider's accounts
- Demonstrate that the variance of the parts is a complete description of the
variance of the whole
- Give information on trends in the experience of the provider to feed back
into the actuarial control cycle

## Carrying out an analysis of surplus

To properly analyse the performance of a product, set of products, or
entire financial service product provider,
the actual results need to be compared to those expected.

Expected results can be modelled by using the models developed during
product development.
Assumptions within models should be consistent.

By applying expected new business and renewal levels to such models and
aggregating the results, sets of revenue accounts can be developed.
Modelled accounts can be compared with actual accounts to derive the
deviation from expectations.

The deviation can be analysed to help answer the questions arising,
particularly concerning investment returns and product development costs.
Expenses are ideally analysed as unit costs.

## Sources of surplus / profit

Actual vs expected experience of

- Claims: mortality, morbidity, claim frequency, claim amounts
- Volume: new business, withdrawal / lapses
- Other cashflows: investment income and gains, expenses, commission, prems /
conts
- Other factors: salary growth, inflation, taxation

Other sources

- Strategic events e.g. failure of counterparty, business restructure
- Change to valuation method or assumptions

## Levers on surplus / profit

- [2018 April Paper 2 Q3](40-2018-04-02.md#3)

Used to try to

- Reduce likelihood of claim e.g. through good underwriting
- Reduce cost of claims e.g. through management procedures or reinsurance
- Control expenses
- Increase renewals and/or reduce lapses
- Follow an investment policy that increases investment returns (subject to
acceptable level of risk)
- Adopt and effective tax management policy

## Distribution of any surplus / profit arising

Life insurance: distributable surplus is allocated to with-profit
policyholders and/or shareholders or retained as working cap.

For other corps, surplus belongs to shareholders and is either

- Retained in the business
- Distributed as dividends

For benefit schemes any surplus is usually retained within the scheme and
may be used to enhance the benefits of members or reduce future conts of
members and/or employer.
It may not be possible to return surplus to the sponsor.

## Issues surrounding the amount of surplus to distribute

- provision of capital
- margins for future adverse experience
- business objectives of the company
- policyholders' reasonable expectations
- other stakeholders' reasonable expectations (staff)

Life insurance

- Provision of capital
- Margins for future adverse experience
- Business objectives
- Policyholder, shareholder and other stakeholder (incl staff) expectations

For benefit schemes

- Legislation: likely _the_ major factor
- Scheme rules
- Tax treatment
- Discretion of the sponsor / managers

If the sponsor or the managers of the fund are able to decide how to apply
the surplus or deficit, this decision will depend on

- Risk exposure of various parties
- Source of surplus or deficit
- Expected effect of that decision on industrial relations

Where surplus is to be applied to the advantage of the sponsor,
or deficit is to be made good by the sponsor,
a further decision would be required relating to the _pace_ at which this will
happen.
