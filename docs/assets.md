A provider should select investments that are appropriate to the:

- nature
- term
- currency, and
- uncertainty

of the liabilities, and

- the provider’s appetite for risk.

Subject to the above, the investments should also be selected so as to maximise the overall return on the assets, where overall return includes both income and capital.

The institution needs to consider any investment restrictions ...

... e.g. due to regulation.

The institution will consider the size of the assets in absolute terms and the level of free assets.

The institution will consider the need for diversification between and within asset classes.

The institution should consider the tax treatment of investments ...

... and of the institutional investor ...

... as this will influence the preference for income vs capital gains.

The institution should consider its cashflow needs ...

... if low, consider assets that provide most of their return through capital growth rather than income ...

... whereas if significant income is needed ...

... the institution may prefer liquid assets and assets that give most of their return through income.

The institution should consider the impact on solvency or accounting requirements.

The institution will consider the strategy adopted by competitors.
