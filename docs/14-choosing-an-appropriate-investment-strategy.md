## Institutional investment objecives

Investment objective should be clearly stated and quantified where possible.
It should encompass the permitted degree of risk, required return, and
cashflow timing.

## Risk

Can be defined as

- Probability of default
- Expected variability of default
- Risk of underperforming (compared with competitors)
- Probability of failing to meet the investor's objectives,
and this is the most practical definition when considering investment strategy

The risk appetite of an inistitution will depend on

- Nature of the institution
- Constraints of its governing body and documentation
- Legal or statutory controls

## Factors influencing an institution's investment strategy

[2019 September Paper 1 Q7-i](40-2019-09-01.md#7-i)

| Sounder | Tractors |
|---|---|
| Size of assets (abs / rel to liabs) | Tax (asset / investor) |
| Objectives | Restrictions (statutory) |
| Uncertainty of liabs | Accrual of liabs|
| Nature of liabs | Currency of liabs |
| Diversification | Term of liabs |
| Existing assets | Other investors |
| Return (risk-adj, net, expected, long-term) | Risk appetite |
| | Solvency and accounting retrictions |

## Factors influencing an individual's investment strategy

The main factors are similar to those of an institution
but the balance of the factors will change. In particular,
individuals should consider.

- The characteristics of their assets and liabs and matching cashflows
    - usually, liabs are predominantly real (i.e. linked to inflation)
    and domestic - so real, domestic assets are preferred
    - when are asset proceeds required
    - to what extent are they concerned with income over capital gains
- Risk
    - the stability of cashflows should not be a factor for long-term
    investing, but the short-term horizon of many individuals can make
    asset values seem important
    - diversification
- Returns from different asset classes
    - tax
    - feel-good factors
- Constraints
    - level of excess assets
    - uncertainty of future income and outgo
    - risk appetite of investor
- Practical considerations
    - level of assets may make direct investment in some assets impossible
    - relatively high expenses when investing small amounts
    - likely lack of investment experise and information
