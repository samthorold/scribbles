A provider should select investments that are appropriate to the:

- nature
- term
- currency, and
- uncertainty

of the liabilities, and

- the provider's appetite for risk.

Subject to the above, the investments should also be selected so as to maximise the overall return on the assets, where overall return includes both income and capital.

If nothing at all springs to mind ...

- return
    - Investors' preferences will be driven by the expected return on a particular asset class ...
    - ... which will be linked to its risk premium, which in turn will depend on the characteristics of the asset.
- risk
    - Investors' preferences will be driven by their understanding of the risks of each asset class.
- matching
    - Investors' preferences will be driven by their liabilities and any changes to their liabilities ...
    - ... so the nature, term, certainty and currency of liabilities will influence their preferences.
- cashflows
    - Investors' preference for income or capital growth from investments is driven by their cashflow requirements.
- Tax
    - If investors pay different tax rates on income and gains this will influence their preference ...
    - ... as will any changes in the tax regime impacting the income and gains available from an asset class.
- Supply and demand
    - Investors' preferences will be driven by the supply of and demand for a particular asset class ...
    - ... and any significant changes to economic conditions.
- Other factors that affect investors' preferences:
    - changes in the regulatory regime
    - the level of education provided to investors
    - the price of alternative investments
    - the introduction of new asset classes
    - any uncertainty in the political climate
    - â€˜fashion', sentiment or ethical issues
    - marketing
    - sometimes no discernible reason.

The principal aim is to meet the liabilities as they fall due ...

... and invest taking an acceptable level of risk.

The institution should consider its objectives.

The institution should consider the expected long-term returns from different asset classes.

The institution should choose investments that are in line with its risk appetite.

The institution's chosen strategy may wish to closely match its liabilities by:

- nature
- currency
- term
- uncertainty of amount and timing.

The institution needs to consider any investment restrictions ...

... e.g. due to regulation.

The institution will consider the size of the assets in absolute terms and the level of free assets.

The institution will consider the need for diversification between and within asset classes.

The institution should consider the tax treatment of investments ...

... and of the institutional investor ...

... as this will influence the preference for income vs capital gains.

The institution should consider its cashflow needs ...

... if low, consider assets that provide most of their return through capital growth rather than income ...

... whereas if significant income is needed ...

... the institution may prefer liquid assets and assets that give most of their return through income.

The institution should consider the impact on solvency or accounting requirements.

The institution will consider the strategy adopted by competitors.

The institution should consider whether it will continue to accrue further liabilities.
