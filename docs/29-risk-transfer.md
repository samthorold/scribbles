## Responses to risk

When faced with a risk, each stakeholder needs to decide whether to

- Avoid
- Reduce (prob, severity, both)
- Reject the need for financial coverage (e.g. trivial or diversified)
- Retain
- Transfer through premium payment
- Partly retain and partly transfer

Choice of mitigation strategy will depend on

- Impact on prob and severity
- Feasability of implementation
- Cost of implementation
- Secondary risks and how they might be dealt with

Extent of risk transfer will depend on

- Prob of risk occurring
- Risk appetite and existing resources to finance the risk event
- Cost of transferring
- Willingness of a third party to accept the risk

## Reinsurance - benefits and costs

The benefits of reinsurance have to be weighed up against the cost.
Reinsurance premium will include loadings for profits and contingencies.

Benefits

- Reduction in claims vol
    - Smoother profits
    - Reduced capital reqs
    - Increased capacity to write more business and achieve diversificatoin
- Limit large losses from
    - Single event on single risk
    - Single event
Resulting in
    - Reduced risk of insolvency
    - Increased capacity to write larger risks
- Access to expertise of reinsurer

## Types of reinsurance

### Proportional

Reinsurer covers an agreed proportion of each risk.
Proportion may

- Be constant for all risks covered (quota share)
- Vary by risk covered (surplus)

Both forms have to be administered automatically and therefore req a treaty.

**Quota share** is widely used by ceding providers to spread risk, write larger
portfolios of risk and encourage reciprocal business.

It is simple to administer. But, quota share cedes the same proportion of low
and high variance risks, and of small and large risks.
It does not cap the cost of very large claims.

**Surplus** specifies a retention limit and a max level of cover available from
the reinsurer.
The proportion of risk ceded is then used in the same way as quota share.
The retention limit may be fixed for all risks or variable at the
discretion of the cedant.

Surplus cover enables a ceding provider to write larger risks, which might
otherwise be beyond its writing capacity.
It is flexible and enables the ceding provider to "fine-tune" its experience
for the class concerned.

### Non-proportional

Under excess of loss reinsurance the reinsurer agrees to indemnify the ceding
company for the amount of any loss above a stated excess point.
Usually, the reinsurer will cover up to a stated upper limit,
with the insurer purchasing further layers of XL cover,
which stack on top of the primary layer, from different reinsurers.

There are different forms of non-proportional (excess of loss, XL) reinsurance

- Risk XL: relates to individual losses and affects only one insured risk
at any one time
- Aggregate XL: Covers the aggregate of losses above an excess point and
subject to an upper limit sustained from defined perils over a defined period
usually one year
- Stop loss: Form of aggregate XL that provides cover based on total claims
from all perils on a ceding company's whole account (or a major class)
- Catastrophe XL: Pays if a "catastrophe" as defined in the reinsurance
contract occurs (no standard definition of catastrophe).

The main uses of excess of loss reinsurance are

- Permit a ceding provider to accept risks that could lead to large claims
- Stabilise results of ceding provider by reducing claims fluctuations
- Reduce the risk of insolvency from large losses

## Alternative risk transfer (ART)

ART is an alternative to traditional risk transfer.
It involves tailor-made solutions for risks that the conventional reinsurance
market would not regard as insurable or does not have the capacity to absorb.

Examples include

- Integrated risk covers
- Securitisation (e.g. catastrophe bonds)
- Post loss funding
- Insurance derivatives
- Swaps

Reasons for taking out ART contracts

- Provision of cover that might otherwise be unavailable
- Stabilisation of results
- Cheaper cover
- Tax advantages
- Greater security of payment
- Management of solvency margins
- More effective provision of risk management
- As a source of capital
