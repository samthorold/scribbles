## Risk profile of asset classes

Assets with the greatest risk have the potential for the greatest long-term
returns.

The extent to which investors seek a matched position depends on their risk
appetite, which relates to their level of free capital.

Fixed-interest government bonds are exposed to inflation risk.

Corporate bonds are exposed to; default, inflation, marketability, and
liquidity risk.

Equities are exposed to; default, inflation, marketability, and uncertain
dividend risk.

## Supply and demand

As demand for an asset rises, the price of the asset will rise.

Demand for most investments is very price elastic, as there are close
substitutes.

## Interest rates

SHort-term interest rates are determined largely by government policy,
as the gov balances;

- Need to control inflation
- Need to encourage economic growth
- Management of the level of the exchange rate

The level of interest rates is usually a little above the level of inflation.

## Factors affecting the level of the bond market

### Theories of the yield curve

The yield curve plots gross redemption yield against term to redemption.

**Expectations theory**: yield reflects expectations of future short-term
interest rates and inflation.

**Inflation risk premium**: investors require an additional yield on fixed
longer-term bonds to compensate for the risk that inflation is higher than
expecetd.

**Liquidity preference**: investors require an additional yield on less
liquid (longer-term) bonds.

**Market segmentation**: yields at each term are determined by supply and
demand at that term.
Demand comes principally from institutional investors trying to match liabs.

### Theories of the _real_ yield curve

The _real_ yield curve plots real gross redemption yield against term to
redemptioni (index-linked bonds).
The difference between the conventional (fixed) yield curve and the real
(index-linked) yield curve is approximately the market's expectation of future
inflation.

### Principal economic factors affecting bond yields

- inflation
- short-term interest rates
- public sector borrowing - fiscal deficit
- exchange rate
- institutional cashflow
- returns on alternative investments
- (other economic factors)

### Comparison of corp and gov bond yields

Economic factors effecting the prospects of companies will increase the
perceived riskiness of corporate bonds and hence the yield margin of corps
over govs.

If govs are offering poor returns, investors may switch to invest in corps,
further narrowing the gap in yields between corps and govs.

## Factors affecting the level of the equity market

The general level of the equity market is determined by investors'
expectations of future corporate profitability and the value of those
profits.

### Factors affecting demand

- Expectations of real interest rates and inflation
- Invetors' perceptions of the riskiness of equity investment
- Real level of economic growth in the economy
- Expectations of currency movements

### Factors affecting supply

- Number of rights issues
- Share buy-backs
- Privatisations

## Level of the property market

Economic factors affecting demand

- Economic growth
- Inflation
- Real interest rates
- (Institutional cashflow)
- (Exchange rates)

Inelastic supply of property, for example due to planning restrictions,
magnifies the impact of the factors on overall property values.

Residential property values are driven by supply and demand.
Supply can be influenced by gov policy.

Economic factors can affect

- Occupation
- Development cycles
- Investment market

Interaction between occupational demand and supply determines the level
of rents.

Capital value is determined by the investment markets.

## Other influences on the investment market

### Demand factors

- Changing investors' perceptions of the characteristics of the asset, particularly
risk and return
- External factors alter the demand for an asset, despite investors'
perceptions of the characteristics otherwise remaining the same
    - investors' cashflows
    - investors' preferences
        - change in liabs
        - change in regulation or tax regimes
        - political uncertainty
        - sentiment (fashion) altering for no discernible reason
        - marketing
        - investor education, perhaps by suppliers of an asset
        - no other discernable reason (besides sentiment/fashion)
    - price of other assets (which may be substitutes)

### Supply factors

- Increase in supply will lead to downward pressure on the price of an asset
- Supply of financial asset will be increased by new issues and decreased by
redemptions
- Supply of gov bonds is influenced by fiscal deficit and the Government's
strategy for financing the deficit
- Supply may also be increased by technological innovation, particularly
true of derivatives markets
