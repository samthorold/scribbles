## Active and passive investment management

_Active_: the investment manager has few restrictions on investment choice
within a broad remit.
It is expected to produce greater returns despite extra dealing costs and
risks of poor judgement.

_Passive_: involves holding assets closely reflecting those underlying an
index or specified benchmark.
The investment manager has little freedom of choice.
There remains the risk of tracking errors and the index performing poorly.

## Tactical asset allocation

A short-term departure from the benchmark position in pursuit of higher
returns.
It is important to consider

- Expected extra returns compared with additional risk
- Any constraints on changing the portfolio
- Expenses of making the switch
- Any problems of switching a large amount of assets

## Risk budgeting

The process that establishes how much risk should be taken and where it is
most efficient to take the risk (in order to maximise return).

Two parts to the risk budgeting process

1. Deciding how to allocate the maximum permitted overall risk between active
risk and strategic risk
2. Allocating the active risk budget across the component portfolios

## Portfolio construction

Portfolios are usually constructed to _ensure security_ and _achieve high
long-term returns_.

Quantifying risk involves dividing risk into

- _Strategic_: strategic benchmark may not match the liabilities
- _Active_: active managers may make bad choices relative to the benchmark
- _Structural_: aggregate of individual manager benchmarks may not equal
the total benchmark for the fund

## Monitoring invesment performance and strategy

Necessary because

- Liability structure may have changed significantly
- Funding or free asset position may have changed significantly
- Manager performance may be significantly below other managers

Other constraints to manager performance include a shortage of cashflow
within the provider.

## Measuring investment risks

- _Historic tracking error_: annualised standard deviation of the difference
between actual fund performance and the benchmark performance.
- _Forward-looking tracking error_: modelling the future experience of the fund
based on its current holdings and likely future volatility and correlations to
other holdings.

Strategic risk can be measured using forward and backward looking approaches.

Other considerations include how much capital to hold against risk
(Solvency II) and diversification benefits.

## Analysis of investment performance against a benchmark

Use a spreadhseet of cashflows taking care over the treatment of income.

### Time-weighted rate of return (TWRR)

IRR, i.e. the discount rate that makes PV income equal PV outgo.
Not ideal because deposits and withdrawals are out of the manager's control.

### Money-weighted rate of return (MWRR)

Same way benchmark indices are calculated
