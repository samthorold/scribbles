## Risk identification

Everyone in an organisation should be involved in risk identification, at all
levels.

Techniques

- Risk classification (to ensure full coverage)
- Risk checklists e.g. as used for setting regulatory capital requirements
- Experience of staff joining from similar organisations, consultants,
eperts
- Project management risk identification techniques
    - High-level prelim analysis
    - Brainstorming
    - Desktop analysis (_what_?)
    - Risk register / risk matrix

## Risk categories

[2019 September Paper 2 Q2-ii](40-2019-09-02.md#2-ii)

- Market
- Credit
- Liquidity
- Business
- Operational
- External

### Market risk

Related to changes in investment market values or other features correlated
with investment markets.

- Changes in asset values
- Investment market value changes on liabilities
- Mismatching assets and liabilities

### Credit risk

Failure of third parties to meet their obligations.

- Default risk (and somewhat related - credit spread changes)
- Counterparty risk (including settlement risk)
- General debtors

Security is a way of reducing credit risk when lending money to a third party.

Credit ratings are an indication of credit worthiness i.e. the liklihood of
default.

### Liquidity risk

Risk that, while the entity may be solvent, the entity may not be able to meet
obligations as they fall due (or can only secure resources at excessive cost).

For a market, this is the risk that the volume of asset traded will have an
adverse price effect.

Liquidity, how quickly an asset can be turned into cash at a predictable price),
is not the same as marketability (how easy it is to buy and sell an asset).

### Business risk

Specific to the business undertaken.

- Underwriting risk
- Poor claims experience
- Financing a project that is unsuccessful
- Exposure to a particular risk is greater than expected
- Lower sales volume than expected
- (Competitor actions)

### Operational risk and external risk

Risk of loss due to failed internal systems, processes, people, or external
events.

- Errors in calculations and/or projections
- Wrong choice of model
- Inadequate internal processes
- Dominance of a single person
- Reliance on third parties
- Failure to plan properly (for external events)
- Risk of (further) regulation

Natural disasters are systematic (i.e. non-diversifiable) risks.

## Example qus

_Risks of new unit-linked product launch with simple fee structure_

Risk of expenses exceeding charges, and losses being made.
This risk is higher than otherwise because of the charges cap.

Risk, although expenses don't exceed charges, that the difference is less than
assumed when profitability was assessed.

Risk of mismatch between charges and expenses.
% charge may match investment costs, but general admin costs, and particularly
transaction/premium collection costs may be in money terms.

Risk of lower than average policy size/premiums so that charges are too low.

Risk of higher than expected frequency of premium payments –
exacerbates the above charges risks.

Risk of higher than expected inflation of expenses.

Risk of lower than expected investment performance.
Charges will be lower.
Ability to recruit and retain policyholders will be reduced.
Possible loss of preferred provider status with government.

Risk of high levels of fund switches/ redirections.
No explicit charges possible to cover these.

High business volume risks.
Strain on capital - may start to run out.
A big issue for this contract as likely to need non-unit reserves
to cover future excess of expenses over charges.
Normally reserves are contract by contract calc i.e.
some small pols definitely need reserves,
even if the overall portfolio wouldn't.
The charge cap is an increased guarantee risk,
so further increases capital required.
Similarly a guarantee on the deposit fund price not falling further
increases capital.
Administration levels may become too stretched leading to poor publicity for
company.

Low business volume risks.
Unable to recoup fixed development costs of product,
including costs of setting up new funds.
High per policy costs result,
and these may have to be disclosed.
Unable to cover running costs -
need to meet critical mass of funds under management for product to break even.

Business volume risks exacerbated because this is a new savings initiative -
no track record/historic data available to confidently estimate popularity of
idea/take up of this company's policies.
Such risks arise from model/parameter/data errors/random fluctuations.
Possible to study similar initiatives/data from overseas, but relevance
questionable.

Risk that government might withdraw/reduce incentives.
Depends on whether cross party support has been gained so as to guarantee them
long term.
Otherwise, economic/fiscal cycles vary and what was once a savings priority
for the government becomes less so in future.
Risk that government withdraws preferred provider status to this company.

Risk that govt may drive charge cap lower in future.
Or start imposing harsher conditions on providers eg regular/expensive
disclosures to policyholders,
due diligence exercises expensive to comply with.

Risk that the savings initiative fails eg public simply don't like the idea of
savings, or have something against this particular company or industry e.g.
scandals, adverse PR.

Risks from lower than expected persistency
(also mortality/morbidity contribute).
Persistency rates always difficult to estimate,
but especially here with new product/incentives.
Early withdrawals won't cover their initial set up costs,
as no up front or exit charges allowed.
There will be a very long term payback period.
This further increases capital required up front.
Incentives may drive withdrawal behaviour
e.g. spot withdrawal of funds after payment of incentive/loyalty bonus.
A range of related risks will occur
e.g. economic/unemployment/inflation risks/personal circumstances of
policyholder changes.
This will affect the need for funds to be withdrawn.
But also will affect level of disposable income –
risks also of premium reductions; lower than expected prem increases.
At later durations, the idea is that funds will have built up and profits arise
from each year the policy continues.
So lower than expected late duration persistency will also be a risk.

Liquidity risks
e.g. unexpected economic downturn - harder to get good value for assets,
people want their money more, unlikely to be able to delay paying out to savers.

Different risks could all be happening together
e.g. weak economy means poor investment returns and lower job
prospects/disposable incomes.

Risks from competitors.
Competitor products may be more appealing to customers,
or directly try to undercut the charges being levied by this company.
Extent of risk again depends on preferred provider status and ability to
market a simplified unit-linked product.

Risks from marketability.
The low cost nature of the product means that direct sales is likely,
at least for simplified product.
This sales channel largely relies on the saver buying,
rather than being sold, a policy and therefore low sales volumes are a
particular risk.
The more complex/flexible product may involve other distribution channels,
e.g. brokers or salesforce, introducing misselling risk.

Risks from new systems/infrastructure.
Likely to need at least some new premium collection systems
e.g. to deal with high frequency/small premium transactions.
Risk of teething problems, or failures with the new systems.
A complete overhaul of these systems to new digital technology may be very
costly and risky.
Specific risks around data security, systems/network outages.
Related risk that such issues could lead to bad publicity or regulatory fines.

Similarly, may be involved with new payment partners,
e.g. online/supermarket/smartphone interfaces.
These may have high charges or bring operational risks.

Risk of loss of value from lapse of existing products
(and possible re-entry in to new product with this or other companies).
Where this new product can perform the same role as existing products of the
company, it is at risk of lapses on the existing products where their charges
are higher than this new product.
The extent of the risk depends on whether there are any exit penalties on the
existing products, and how they compare with the loss of future profits on exit.
Associated risk from complexity/time/expense of having to manage such
policyholder activity, which may be large in volume.

This is a new product so there is a risk of lack of data leading to incorrect
assumptions.

There is a misselling risk if the more complex aspects of the product are
oversimplified.

General operational risks e.g. fraud, poor customer service, increased regs to
deal with.

Risk of adverse changes to tax rates/rules or status.
