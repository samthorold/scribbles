# 2019 September Paper 2

## 1.

### 1-i.

*\[5\]*

*Set out the reasons why ABC may wish to purchase XYZ.*

---

Exposure to XYZ's domestic market

- economy in XYZ's country may be growing rapidly - creating a good opportunity for profits
- motor insurance market better margins than ABC's market's margins
- ABC may feel this is less risky or expensive than starting a subsidiary in XYZ's market

Acquire knowledge and expertise

- XYZ is an established player that will have acquired good talent along the way
- ABC can learn from these employees

Synergies

Market leader

- XYZ is a more attractive prospect than other firms in the industry
- who have smaller market shares

Economies of scale

- by combining with ABC, the probably smaller domestic firm XYZ may see expenses drop and margins increase
- perhaps lifting XYZ back into profits

Good price

- given XYZ has not been profitable in recent years
- which is likely reflected in the price of XYZ

### 1-ii.

*\[10\]*

*Describe, using examples, how XYZ can manage and control its risks in connection with its motor insurance policies.*

The risk management process can be used

The actuarial control cycle can be used

#### Transfer

(Not really for this qu.)

Reinsurance (and other risk transfer tools, e.g. ART) could also be used.

Risk transfer tools may help XYZ to smooth its profits ...

... and reduce its exposure, e.g. to single large risks.

XYZ may benefit from the expertise of a reinsurer.

The use of reciprocal quota share reinsurance can improve diversification.

#### Diversification

Diversification can be between:

- different lines of business
    - age group (as well as 18–24s, could also sell to 25–45s, 45–65s, over 65s
    - policy type (could sell both comprehensive and third-party policies)
    - gender (female, male)
    - number of lives covered (could sell both individual or family policies)
    - vehicle type (could cover not only cars but also motorcycles, vans etc).
- geographical location 
    - living in different areas
    - travelling to different areas
- reinsurance provider
- asset classes (eg bonds and cash)
- assets held within a class (eg corporate bonds issued by different companies)

#### Underwriting at proposal stage

Underwriting helps to reduce anti-selection.

Underwriting can help to identify risks for which special terms need to be quoted ...

... or which need to be declined, e.g. individuals with several previous claims.

Underwriting helps bring actual claim experience closer to that assumed when pricing.

Underwriting helps XYZ to classify risks into homogenous groups for which a standard premium can be charged.

XYZ can use a range of rating factors ...

... to ensure that all risks are rated fairly.

Financial underwriting helps reduce the risk of over insurance ...

... e.g. the insurance amount for a three-year-old car exceeding the cost of a new car.


#### Claims controls

Claims control systems help to mitigate the consequences of a financial risk that has occurred.

Effective claims control helps guards against fraudulent or excessive claims.

The cost of the claims control system must be in proportion to its benefit ...

... so that the costs of investigating the claim are low relative to the reduction in claims cost.

A no claims discount system could be used or an excess introduced (if they are not already used).

Tighter policy wording could be used to reduce the incidence of claims ...

... e.g. a vehicle must be kept in a garage overnight.

#### Management controls

Management control systems include those for:

- data recording
    - Good quality data can help to reduce operational risks. 
- accounting and auditing
    - Effective accounting and auditing cannot change the risks accepted ...
    - ... but enables proper provisions to be established. 
- monitoring of liabilities
    - Monitoring liabilities can help protect XYZ against unacceptably high aggregations of risk ...
    - ... and help check that the business mix is as expected. 
- care over options and guarantees.
    - The experience of such guarantees can be fed back into pricing and underwriting ...
    - ... e.g. XYZ may guarantee that premiums will not rise by more than x% p.a. for loyal customers. 

### 1-iii.

*\[10\]*

*Set out possible reasons for the worsening of the funding position in the defined benefit scheme.*

#### Assumptions not as expected

**Investment return** lower than expected due to

- a change in asset allocation
- a poor performing fund manager
- a mismatch between assets and liabilities
- an inappropriate choice of assets

**Mortality** - people may live longer than expected

**Inflation** - may have been higher than expected ...

... leading the all of the following being higher

- guaranteed pension increases
- discretionary pension increases
- salary increases

**Other experience** may have been worse than expected e.g.

- scheme expenses may have been higher than expected
- more members may be married than expected
    - if scheme provides a dependent's pension

More members may exercise options on terms that give rise to a loss for the scheme, e.g. there may be more early retirements on more generous terms than expected.

Fewer members may exercise options than expected on terms that give a profit to the scheme e.g.:

- fewer members than expected transfer out of the scheme
- fewer members than expected take up cash at retirement.

Expenses may have been higher than expected, eg due to a special valuation required following closure of the scheme.


#### Benefit improvements

Members' past benefits may have been improved, e.g. due to sex equalisation

#### Contributions

Contributions paid over the period may have been lower than expected

#### Change in assumptions

The assumptions may have been made more prudent.

The scheme may have chosen to strengthen the assumptions ...

... or there may have been a regulatory requirement to strengthen the assumptions.

**Discount rate** - A lower discount rate may be used to reflect assets with lower expected returns ...

... or due to a change in market conditions over the period ...

... placing a higher value on the liabilities.

There may have been a change in the method used to set the discount rate ...

... e.g. moving from a single discount rate to a yield curve approach.

**Inflation** - A higher inflation assumption may be used to reflect higher inflation expectations (e.g. due to changing government policy).

**Mortality** - A stronger base table may have been used or greater allowance for improvements.

#### Other

Interest on existing deficit.

### 1-iv.

*\[8\]*

*Discuss potential options available to improve the funding position of the defined benefit scheme.*



### 1-v.

*\[7\]*

*Discuss the key risks of the defined contribution pension scheme. In your answer you should comment on each risk from the perspective of XYZ and the scheme members*

the risks lie primarily with the members.

For example, if investment performance is poor then each member’s accumulated fund will be smaller than expected and hence the annual pension lower than expected.

If an annuity is purchased at retirement then longevity risk passes to the annuity provider at this time (although annuity rates will reflect the annuity provider’s views of future life expectancy).

If an annuity is not purchased then longevity risk remains with the member.

Expenses risk may lie with the employer or the members depending upon whether the expenses are met separately by the employer or are met from charges taken from the accumulated fund.
