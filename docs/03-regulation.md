Like many markets, an unregulated market for financial services may not produce an economically optimal outcome, in which all investors make the best investment decisions and risk is allocated optimally throughout the economy.

The most important cause of market failure in financial services markets is likely to be the **lack of (perfect) information available**, in particular to private investors, concerning the financial services that they are buying and the risks being taken by the institutions in which they invest.

To counteract this problem, the market for financial services is usually subject to some form of regulation. Indeed, given the nature of financial services – ie their **complexity, their often long-term nature and the potentially large sums of money involved** – the extent of regulation within the financial service sector is often much greater than that found in the markets for other goods and services.


## Aims of regulation

[2020 September Paper 1 Q9i](40-2020-09-01.md#9-i)

- Give confidence in the financial system
- Reduce financial crime
- Inefficiencies corrected
- Protect consumers of financial products

---

- correct perceived market inefficiencies and promote efficient and orderly markets
- protect consumers of financial products
- maintain confidence in the financial system
- help reduce financial crime

---

- prudence and the control of risk
- fair and consistent treatment across providers
- having confidence in the solution, eg sufficiently well understood, but not too time consuming.

## Direct costs

- Administering the regulation
    - collection and examination of information provided by market participants
    - otherwise monitoring their activities.
- Compliance for the regulated firms
    - maintaining appropriate records
    - collating the requisite information
    - supplying it to the regulator and/or the investor.
    

## Indirect costs

- Alteration in consumer behaviour
- Undermining the sense of professional responsibility amongst advisors
- Reduction in self-regulation by the market
- Reduced product innovation
- Reduced competition

## Need for regulation

- Maintain confidence in the sector
- Deal with information asymmetries

## Functions of a regulator

- Influencing and reviewing government policy
- Vetting and registering firms and individuals authorised to conduct business
- Supervising the prudential management of financial organisations
- Enforcing regulations
- Providing information to consumers and the public

## Areas addressed by regulation

- Information asymmetry
    - Occur when one party has relevant information and another party does not
    - Can lead to anti-selection
    - Asymmetries are exacerbated by the complex and long-term nature of
    financial products
    - Mitigation tools include
        - Disclosure of information in plain language
        - Chinese walls
        - Cooling off periods
        - Whistle blowing
- Maintain confidence
    - Danger that problems in one area of the financial system spread
    - Mitigation tools include
        - Checks on capital adequacy of providers
        - Ensuring practitioners are competent and act with integrity
        - Industry compensation schemes
        - Ensuring orderly and transparent markets
        - Stock exchange requirements

Regime | Pros | Cons
---|---|---
**Unregulated markets**<br/>No regulations imposed. |+ No cost.<br/>+ May encourage innovation in the industry.|- No protection for customers and therefore risks sub-optimal outcomes for them.<br/>- Low level of market confidence.<br/>- Reliant on companies behaving appropriately.
**Voluntary codes of conduct**<br/>Companies choose whether they follow the regulation. |+ Can be effective in providing protection for consumers for some markets.<br/>+ More cost effective than statutory regulation.|- Exposed to rogue operators who choose not to comply.
**Self-regulation**<br/>Regulation and compliance are operated by the market participants.|+ Costs likely to be lower than statutory regulation.<br/>+ Undertaken by the experts who understand the industry.<br/>+ These experts have the incentive to optimise cost vs effectiveness.<br/>+ May lead to increased innovation.|- Lack of independence and so a risk of loss of consumer confidence (but better than unregulated).<br/>- Regulator is very close to the market, so may be perceived to be, or actually be, weak.<br/>- Relies on whistle blowers to highlight inappropriate behaviour.
**Statutory regulation**<br/>The government or regulator sets down the rules to be followed.|+ Greatest market confidence.<br/>+ Should be less open to abuse and ensure fair markets.<br/>+ Ensures a level playing field, as all companies subject to the rules.|- Likely highest costs<br/>- May stifle innovation.
**Mixed**<br/>Combination of the other regimes. |+ Can help ensure that the appropriate level of regulation is applied to different sectors.|- Requires co-operation between those providing the different types of regulation.

Each of these regimes can adopt any of the following forms

- Prescriptive: detailed rules
- Freedom of action: rules only on publicity of information
- Outcome-based: prescribed tolerated outcomes

## Role of major financial institutions

Major financial institutions support the regulatory framework

- Central bank: controls or influences economic variables and is a lender of
last resort
- State intervention: provide products and control premium rates
- Larger market participants:
    - influence rates
    - allow smaller participants to find niche markets
    - but, may distort the  market and use up too much of the regulator's
    resources

## Treating consumers fairly

**Information asymmetry**

1. Consumers can be confident that they are dealing with firms where the fair treatment of customers is central to the corporate culture.
2. Products and services marketed and sold in the retail market are designed to meet the needs of identified consumer groups and are targeted accordingly.
3. Consumers are provided with clear information and are kept appropriately informed before, during and after the point of sale.
4. Where consumers receive advice, the advice is suitable and takes account of their circumstances.
5. Consumers are provided with products that perform as firms have led them to expect, and the associated service is of an acceptable standard and as they have been led to expect.
6. Consumers do not face unreasonable post-sale barriers imposed by firms to change product, switch provider, submit a claim or make a complaint.
