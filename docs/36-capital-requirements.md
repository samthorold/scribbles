## Regulatory capital

Regulatory solvency capital requirement is the total of

- Prudential margins in the regulatory liability valuation basis
- An amount of additional solvency capital in excess of the regulatory
provisions

There are different approaches to the balance between the two components.

Prudent provisions and simple formula-based additional capital reqs make it
difficult to compare providers (different levels of prudence) and to ensure
that there is sufficient security provided to policy-holders (not risk-based).

## Solvency II

Three pillars

- Quantification of risk exposures and capital reqs
- Supervisory regime
- Disclosure

Two levels of capital reqs

- Minimum capital req (MCR): threshold at which companies may no longer trade
- Solvency capital req (SCR): target level of capital below which companies
need to discuss remedies with the regulator

SCR may be calculated with prescribed standard formula or with an inhouse
model.

Using the standard model means calculation is less complex and less
time-consuming.
But, the standard model aims to capture the risk profile of an
average company and makes approximations when modelling risks.
So it may not be appropriate in practice for all companies.

## Basel accords

Set reqs for the amount of capital that banks need to hold to reflect the level
of risk in the business they write and manage.

## Economic capital

The amount of capital a provider determines is appropriate to hold given its
assets, liabilities, and business objectives.

It is internal rather than regulatory.

Determined based on

- Risk profile of individual assets and liabs
- Correlation of risks
- Desired level of overall credit deterioration the provider wishes to be able
to withstand.

In an economic balance sheet

- Assets and liabs are valued at market values and the excess of assets over
liabs (available capital) is compared to economic capital reqs
- One way to calculate market value of liabs is to use the present value on a
best estimate basis and add on a risk margin

## Internal models

- [2020 September Paper 1 Q7iii](40-2020-09-01.md#7-iii)

Used to calculate economic capital reqs and may be used to determine Solvency
II SCR (provided the model is approved by the regulator).

Internal models aim to create a stochastic model that reflects a company's
business structure.

### Advantages and disadvantages of internal model



Advantages

- The internal model can allow for the particular risks faced by this insurer ...
- ... whereas the standard model reflects risks for the average insurer in the industry.
- The internal model may suggest a lower level of capital is required.
- The insurer may be subject to risks that are not covered by the standard model ...
- ... and these risks can be included in the internal model.
- The internal model can better allow for any diversification benefits enjoyed by the insurer.
- The insurer can use assumptions that better reflect its business.
- Approximations included in the standard model can be removed.
- The insurer can model its own risks to increase its understanding of them.

Disadvantages

- There will be a significant cost to creating and maintaining the model.
- The insurer will need expertise (that it may lack) to create the model.
- It may be time consuming to get regulatory approval for the model.
- If the insurer is similar to the average insurer, there are limited benefits from creating an internal model.
- It may only be appropriate for large insurers, due to the cost and expertise required.
- It may be difficult to justify a lower capital requirement to the regulator ...
- ... the insurer may need to run both models.
- It may be that an expected reduction in capital requirements does not materialise.

### Used for

- Calculate economic capital using different risk measures e.g.
VaR and Tail VaR
- Calculate levels of confidence in the level of economic capital
- Apply different time horizons to the assessment of solvency and risk
- Include risk classes not included in the standard model

## Capital reqs and profits

Profit can be split into trading profit and investment profit.
Investment profit is the investment return earned on available capital.

Pricing financial products should account for the cost of holding reqd
capital (lower return due to restrictions on investment, opportunity cost).
Lower investment profit is then offset by higher trading profit by the
allowance for cost of reqd capital built into prems.
