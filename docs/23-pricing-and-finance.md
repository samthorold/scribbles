## Cost vs price

The _cost_ of benefits is the amount that should theoretically be charged
for them.

The premium(s) or contribution(s) should be calculated by equating the value
of the premiums with the value of benefits and expenses plus a loading for
profit.
This loading should be adjusted to take into account other factors such as

- Tax
- Commission
- Cost of capital
- Contingency margins
- Options and guarantees
- Provisioning bases
- Experience rating
- Investment outcome
- Reinsurance costs

The _price_ of benefits is the amount that can be charged under a
particular set of market conditions and may be different from the _cost_.
Influencing factors include

- Distribution channels used
- Level of competition
- Approach to expense and profit loadings taken
- Provider may have a captive market that is not price sensitive

Once a price is chosen, it should be profit and market tested.

## Issues pricing products

- Data
- Assumptions
    - freq
    - sev
    - business volumes
    - business mix
- wider objectives
    - profit loadings
    - contingency margins for uncertainty

## Reviewing pricing

- components of cost
- analysis of experience
- review exercise itself - modelling outcomes and risk mitigation

Modelled cost

- expected cost of the product from
    - value of benefits
    - value of expenses
    - value of margins, e.g. for profits
- different scenarios can be modelled
- using a deterministic or stochastic approach

Experience analysis

- Data will be needed to analyse experience
- Data may come from a range of sources e.g. past experience, reinsurer, etc.
- Analyse experience over previous years to see if [the event] can be considered unusual
    - trends and random variation
    - abnormal events
    - which if not expected to recur may be ignored for future pricing
    - e.g. a 1-in-200 year event
- wider review of all experience and assumptions can be carried out
- ACC could be used to carry out the review
- Certain industries or locations may be more exposed to accidents
- so it may be important to review the underwriting for different industries or locations.

Practical issues

- May need external expertise
- e.g. an actuarial consultancy could be appointed.

Risk management

- Consider whether risk management options can be used to reduce the cost of claims
- e.g. through greater use of reinsurance.

## Incidence of monies paid in

Main methods of financing benefits are

- Pay-as-you-go (unfunded)
- Funded
    - Lump sum in advance
    - Terminal funding
    - Regular contributions
    - Just-in-time funding
    - Smoothed pay-as-you-go

The choice of method may depend on

- Tax implications (legislative environment)
- Effect on risk allocation

## Contributions to defined benefit schemes

Contribution rate is typically set to meet the value of future benefits
and expenses.

Actual contribution rate may differ because

- Rectify shortfall or surplus in pension scheme
- Reflect sponsor's desire to pay more or less into the scheme
- Legislative constraints
- How the above affects the balance of risk between the parties
