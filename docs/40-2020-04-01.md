Citizens

- motorists
    - car ownership is more affordable
    - as costly repairs expenses are reduced
    - can spend more of their income on other needs
    - e.g. healthcare
    - and so may live longer
    - may drive more recklessly
    - because they bear less of the cost of accidents
    - decreasing mortality
- non-motorists
    - may be worse off if the government finances the insurance by cutting other transport expenses
    - such as buses
    - and they are less able to get to work etc.

Car manufacturers

- may sell more cars as car ownership costs are reduced

Insurers

- may lose business as motorists receive free cover from the government
- but not necessarily all cover
- because the government may not offer terms as good as the insurers'
- margins may increase as they can only sell higher premium policies
- offering better terms than the government
- competition may be reduced as insurers exit the market in response to the government's actions

Regulator

- now many more motorists with cover
- and they all need to be protected
- although the likelihood of the government acting unlawfully is arguably lower than a private insurance company
- may need more staff
- and increased training

Reinsurers
