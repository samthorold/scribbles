## Insolvency of an insurance company

Rarely become insolvent because

- Regulator monitors the financial position
- Regulation requires holding a minimum level of capital

If the financial position becomes serious
(e.g. not meeting the capital reqs)
the insurer may need to

- Close to new business
- Establish a recovery plan

Important to project the insurer's solvency position into the future
using a stochastic or deterministic model with scenario testing.
Issues to be addressed by modelling include

- Estimation of future post-tax profits for equity shareholders
- Current value of surplus assets
- Amount and timing of loan repayments
- Problems arising from industrial relations
- Issues relating to staff benefit schemes, particularly deficits
- Outstanding financial obligations, minority interests, and tax

If there is an acquiring company prepared to take over the business,
it will be necessary to consider

- Location
- Integration of systems
- Relocation of staff or whether there is an adequate labour force available
- Effect on unit costs

In the extreme event that an insurer cannot meet its liabilities,
and a buyer cannot be found to take them on,
there may be a statutory scheme from which some or all of the benefit
payments are paid.
Such a scheme is usually funded by a levy on all other provisions.

## Closure of sponsored benefit scheme

- [2019 April Paper 2 Q1iii](40-2019-04-02.md#iii)

Two types of closure of sponsored benefit scheme

- No new members but benefits accrue for existing members
- No new members and no further benefit accrual for existing members

A benefit scheme may cease due to

- Insolvency of sponsor
- A decision by the sponsor to stop financing benefit provision
(e.g. reduce costs or to follow market trends in benefit provision)

If a scheme ceases, the level of benefits that will be paid will be affected
by

- Rights of beneficiaries
- Expectations of beneficiaries
- Level of assets

At the time of discontinuance, the scheme may be

- Under-funded: consider priority of different groups receiving benefits.
Allowance should be made for determining benefit allocations
- Over-funded: consider whether to pass surplus to employer or
beneficaries.
Must ensure basic rights are met before increasing the benefits.

The approach in either case may be dictated by legislation or scheme rules.

If a benefit scheme is being discontinued,
the following options may exist for the provision of outstanding benefits

- Gradual removal of liabilities by ontinuation of scheme without further accrual of benefits
- Transfer of the liabilities to another scheme with the same sponsor
- Transfer of the funds to the beneficiary,
in cash if permitted by legislation or as a transfer to an insurer,
or to the scheme of a new employer
- Transfer of the funds to an insurance company to invest in a group or
individual pension accrual policy (without guarantees)
- Transfer of the liabilities to an insurance company to guarantee the benefits (buy-out)
- Transfer of the libailities to a central discontinuance fund
(national or industry-wide)

For the first two options,
the employer remains liable for any shortfall in assets relative to the
benefits.
For the third and forth options,
the risk of adverse experience falls to the individual.
For the fifth option,
the insurer takes the risk and will charge an additional premium for this.
For the sixth option,
the discontinuance fund takes the risk and is typically funded through a levy
on solvent sponsors.

Considerations;

- transfer costs
- security of benefits and sponsor
- investment freedom
- economies of scale - through time
- reductions in benefits due to any of the above
