## Approaches to valuing assets and liabilities

Discounted cash flow: long-term discount rate used to value both assets and
liabs.

Market-related approaches: replicating portfolio or actual asset-based approach
can be used to value the liabs.
Assets are valued at market value.
Aim to determine market price of liabs and hence discount rate.

## Fair value

Amount for which an asset could be exchanged or liability settled between
knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction.

**Or**

The amount that the enterprise would have to pay a third party to take over the
liab.

These methods aim to find the market value of liabs, but in practice there is
no secondary market for most liabs.
Therefore the market value cannot be found directly.
Instead we need to try and find market-based assumptions.

## Setting the discount rate

| Method | Valuation of assets | Valuation of liabs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Traditional discounted casflow | Discounted cash flows using long-term rate based on actual holding or notional portfolio | Discount rate is the same
long-term rate as used for assets |
| Replicating portfolio (mark to market) | Market value | Discount rate implied by market price of investments that match liabs - often bonds |
| Replicating portfolio (bond yields plus risk premium) | Market value | Discount rate as in mark to market method, but then adjusted to take account of higher expected returns on other asset classes |
| Asset-based discount rate | Market value | Discount rate is expected return on assets, weighted by proportions held of each asset class | Fair or market value of liabs can be estimated by discounting using risk-fre rates.

## Valuing options

Not always appropriate to assume that the highest cost option is always
exercised.
For example, the attraction of cash or tax-free benefit might mean that
individuals do not exercise an option that is in the money from the
provider's perspective.

The risk of anti-selection must be allowed for when valuing options.

Options in liabs can be valued by finding a market option that replicates it.
A closed form approximation may be used e.g. Black-Scholes.

Contract values are highly sensitive to option pricing methods and
assumptions.
The assumptions used will depend on, among other things

- State of the economy (scenario specific)
- Demographic factors such as age, health, and employment status
- Cultural bias
- Consumer sophistication

## Valuing guarantees

Guarantees are usually best valued by a stochastic approach.
A stochastic model allows for the likelihood of the guarantee biting and its
expected cost.

Guarantees may become more or less onerous on the provider over time depending
on how experience develops.

The value of guarantees and their influences on consumer behaviour will vary
widely according to the economic scenarios and the sophistication of the
market.

## Sensitivity analysis

Can be used

- To help determine the extent of the margins needed in assumptions, to allow
for adverse future experience
- In determining the extent of any global provisions req'd

Sensitivity analysis can be done on a single or multiple assumptions.

## Different methods of allowing for risk in cash flows

- Build in a margin to each assumption
- Apply an overall contingency loading by increasing the liability value by a
certain percentage
- Adjust the discount rate to reflect the risk in the project or liability

Allowance for financial risk in market-consistent or fair valuation is implicit
if a replicating portfolio or stochastic model (calibrated to the market) is
used.
Adjustment for mismatching risk is generally not made so as to achieve
independence of the fair value liability valuation from the actual assets held.

Allowance for non-financial risk is achieved by adjusting the cash flows or the
discount rate, or alternatively through an extra provision or capital req'mt
such as the Solvency II risk margin.

## Different methods of calculating provisions

- Statistical analysis: many claims following known pattern
- Case by case estimate: assessment of claim records where the are few claims
- Proportionate approach: base on amount of net premium yet to expire

An equalisation reserve may be set up to smooth results from year to year where
there are low prob risks with a high and volatile financial outcome.
