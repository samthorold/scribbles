## Risks and uncertainties

Relate to both contributions / premiums and benefits.

### Risks to beneficiary

- Benefits are less valuable than expected / required
- Benefits not received at the expected / required time

### Risks to the provider

- Benefits greater than expected
- Benefits required at an inopportune time

### Risks to the state

There may be a risk for the State that it is expected to put right any losses that the public incurs.

This is particularly relevant if the State provides means-tested benefits, for example a minimum income level in retirement.

Means-testing is a process for establishing whether an individual is eligible to receive benefits and/or how much benefit they should receive.

It is often based on an individual's income or assets or both.

If an individual believes that the minimum income level is sufficient for all their needs, they would be better advised to spend surplus funds on improving their immediate lifestyle.

If the surplus funds were invested to provide a future income, this income might simply reduce the sum that the State would provide by exactly the same amount.

The individual would forgo immediate consumption for no increase in income later.

## Benefit risks

For benefits that are **known**, the risk is that assets are not sufficient to meet liabilities as they fall due.

- Underfunding
- Insolvency of sponsor / provider
- Asset - liability mismatching
- Change in benefit promise (by provider or state)
- Beneficiaries' needs not being met
    - misunderstanding
    - inflation erosion
    - changed circumstances

For benefits that are **not known**

- Investment returns being lower than expected
- Expense charges being higher than expected
- Annuity purchase terms being poorer than expected (e.g. DC scheme)
- Beneficiaries' needs not being met e.g. misunderstanding, inflation erosion,
changed circumstances

For both cases

- Default of sponsor / provider
- Failure of sponsor / provider to pay conts / premiums in a timely manner
- Takeover of sponsor / provider
- Decision of sponsor / provider to reduce benefits
- Inadequate communication by sponsor / provider with beneficiaries
- General economic mismanagement of assets and liabilities by sponsor / provider

## Contribution / premium risks

**Known** in advance

- Conts / prems not affordable and so not met
- Insufficient liquidity to make payments in a timely manner
- Conts / prems linked to an inflationary factor, reducing the risk they
increase morew rapidly than expected
- Conts / prems are not linked to inflation so the value is eroded

**Not known** in advance - **cost and conts / prems will likely be different**.

Future conts / prems will depend on

- Amount of promised benefit
- Probability of individuals being eligible to accrue benefits
- Probability of individuals being able to receive benefits
- Effect of inflation on the level, real level, of the benefits
- Investment return (net of tax) on conts / prems

If there is a shortfall in a defined benefit scheme, the sponsor may be required by legislation to make extra conts. Associated risks include

- Lack of liquid funds
- Excessive conts, which the sponsor may not be able to afford

Further risks include

- Takeover of the sponsor and they are not willing to continue conts
- Extra costs through the provision of guarantees
- Loss of funds due to fraud or misappropriation
- Incorrect benefit payments
- Inappropriate advice
- Administrative costs e.g. comply with changes in legislation
- Decisions by parties to whom power has delegated
- Fines or removal of tax status for non-compliance with legislation
- Changes due to tax rates or status

## Overall security

- Investment risk
- Model, parameter, and data risks
- Strength and security of the sponsor / provider

## Business risks for financial product providers

- Claims
    - Mortality
    - Longevity
    - Morbidity
    - General insurance claim rates and amounts
- Expenses
- Withdrawals / renewals
- New business volume and mix
- Options and guarantees
- Use of reinsurance (insurance company) or insurance (benefit scheme)
