## Type of scheme

The type of pension scheme is the main determinant of who primarily bears the risks.

These risks inevitably result in either the benefits received being less than expected, or the cost of providing these benefits being greater than expected.

The key risks relate to investment, increasing longevity after retirement, and expenses.

Other key risks include:

- credit risk, eg failure of a counterparty such as an insurer
- operational risk, eg fraud, systems failure, regulatory changes.

The pension scheme will need to consider the characteristics of its liabilities, in particular the nature and term, when determining the investment strategy.

The term of the liabilities could be very long.

Pension schemes often receive generous tax breaks relative to other investors, which can influence investment choice.

The investment strategy of a pension scheme is also constrained by regulation, which can restrict or prescribe what the scheme invests in.

### Defined benefit

Scheme rules define the benefits independently of the contributions payable,
and benefits are not directly related to the investments of the scheme.
The scheme may be funded or unfunded.

In a defined benefit scheme, the members’ benefits are promised and independent of investment return, longevity and administration expenses.

The risks therefore lie primarily with the employer.

For example, if investment returns are poor or members are living longer than expected, then the employer needs to pay more money into the scheme in order to be able to provide the benefits.

#### Investments

fixed-interest bonds to match benefits guaranteed in monetary terms

index-linked bonds and equities to match benefits guaranteed in real terms (for example linked to price inflation or salary growth) and expenses

some cash, for liquidity to meet immediate pensions and expense outgo and uncertain outgo, for example any death benefits.


### Defined contribution

Scheme provides benefits where the amount of an individual member's benefits
depends on the contributions paid into the scheme in respect of that member,
increased by the investment return earned on those contributions.

In a defined contribution scheme, the risks lie primarily with the members.

For example, if investment performance is poor then each member’s accumulated fund will be smaller than expected and hence the annual pension lower than expected.

If an annuity is purchased at retirement then longevity risk passes to the annuity provider at this time (although annuity rates will reflect the annuity provider’s views of future life expectancy).

If an annuity is not purchased then longevity risk remains with the member.

Expenses risk may lie with the employer or the members depending upon whether the expenses are met separately by the employer or are met from charges taken from the accumulated fund.


### Defined ambition

Scheme where risks are shared between the different parties involved,
for example scheme members, employers, insurers and investment banks.

## Benefit providers

- State
- Employers

#### Examples from qu

_Why might state want to increase levels of personal savings_

- [2019 April Paper 2 Q2i](40-2019-04-02.md#2-i)

There may be short term economic concerns.

- If savings are too low, spending is likely to be higher.
- This may lead to too-high economic growth and/or inflation in the short term.
- Generally thought that low levels of savings would result in a
unbalanced/unstable economy, too reliant on spending.
- The government may wish to avoid the negative consequences of such an economy.
    - too much build up of personal debt
    - possible current account deficit (imports>exports)
    - unstable economic growth

Longer term, there may be a wish to stimulate investment in the economy.

- Personal savings form the foundation of Institutional or business investments.
- Built up savings can  be invested.
- A greater range of government projects e.g. infrastructure can then be
undertaken.
- Investment in turn should lead to economic growth.
(Circular flow of income effect.)
- Increasingly important for investment to be made e.g. in new
technology/automations, or to deal with shifting trends eg ageing population.
- Alternatively, Institutional investment may simply be increased
into government bonds, avoiding bond yields having to rise so much.
- High levels of personal savings help keep real interest rates low,
and this in turn can further stimulate investment.
- Similarly, businesses may be able to invest more so as to increase
productivity.

There may be other financial reasons.

- If people save for themselves,
the government may be able to cut back on spending,
particularly in the medium to longer term.
- For example, government social security/housing/medical/long term 
care/pension benefits may be reduced.
- Often deposits are needed to either buy or rent a property to live in.

There may be purely paternalistic reasons e.g.

- better society if people have at least some level of savings for emergencies.
- If people are less stressed by only managing to meet their day to day bills
via borrowing/credit.
- The economy may be heading for lower growth or recession.
- The government wants people to get prepared for leaner times ahead by saving
more now.

There may be tax reasons eg want to raise more taxes from savings.

The government may have made election promises/targets to increase personal
savings.

_How might the state achieve this?_

Incentives will be needed for both savers and the company offering the product.

Incentives will be directed towards

- starting a savings plan
- maintaining regular contributions
- increasing contributions
- not cashing in plans (duration of savings likely to be medium/long term,
but depends on government objectives).

Where people are employed, require employers to offer a savings product.
Then opt employees in/auto enrolment.

Provide a government safety/solvency net for these savings products eg protect
savings, up to a financial limit, the same as if they were protected in a bank.

Offer tax incentives to ensure saving is attractive to individuals.
Tax relief on contributions made by the individual or a third party on their
behalf (e.g. partner, employer), tax-free investment returns, tax-free payouts.
Unlikely to offer all three – mix of these incentives will depend on how long
term the government wants the savings to be, and if some types of investor are
to be targeted more than others.

For low income savers, tax incentives will be ineffective
(as likely to not pay any tax).
Instead, offering to shield the savings when being assessed for means tested
benefits likely more effective.

Offer government top ups to the accounts eg initial lump sum paid in by
government, matching regular contributions, top up at exit.
These accounts could be for stated purposes the government wishes to encourage
e.g. educational, house purchase, starting own business.
Likely to be constraints to limit cost/abuse.
Top ups could be designed as loyalty bonuses at appropriate durations to align
with government objectives.

It may be possible to reach a cross-party agreement to unsure confidence in the
scheme.
This could guarantee the stability of the scheme/incentives over the long term
e.g. 30 years eg flat guaranteed tax relief rates,
no increases to the 0.75% cap over that time.

The government could launch communication/education initiatives
to explain to citizens the importance and benefits of savings.
They could offer free advice/information/intervention and review services
e.g. simple projection tools that explain you need to save £x per month now if
you want to get £y in z years' time.

The government give preferred provider status to companies meeting certain
standards.
They could guarantee the company a preferred provider status for minimum
x years, subject to satisfactory performance indicators
e.g. investment returns/financial strength.
This should make it easier for suitable companies to market their products.

The government could offer a guaranteed minimum return on savings.
This should increase the attraction of the product particularly to less
sophisticated savers.

Regulation could be simplified and/or cooling periods introduced, literature
simplified.
This should give confidence to potential buyers.

### Employers

Variety of reasons for sponsoring benefit provision

- Compulsion or encouragement from the State
- Attraction and retention of good quality staff
- Desire to look after employees and their dependents
(paternalistic instinct)
- Pool expenses and  expertise

Benefits can be provided through a formal employer-sponsored scheme.
This can ensure a consitent approach across employees or help the
employer target specific groups such as long servers or high fliers.
Such schemes could be set up to offer members a choice of benefits.

Organisations can tailor the benefits offered to employees using a
flexible benefits system.
Under a flexible benefits system, employees can trade in some of
their existing benefits for other financially equivalent benefits.

Employer-sponsored schemes do not have to be backed by a single
employer but can be sponsored by many employers e.g. industry-wide schemes.

#### Objectives

- [2019 April Paper 2 Q1ii](40-2019-04-02.md#ii)

- control costs – affordability, stability, predictability, flexibility, opportunity cost
- paternalism
- attract and retain good quality employees
- attractive benefits compared to competitors
- reward certain staff, eg high fliers / target benefits provision, eg target the needy
- benefits appreciated by and meet needs of employees
- pooling of expenses / expertise
- follow legislation / freedom from legislation
-  take advantage of tax incentives
- provide a simple scheme (low cost administration and easy to understand)
- encourage employee provision.

### Individuals

Can be beneficiaries and finance benefit provision.
Motives can include

- Compulsion or encouragement by the State or employers
- Individual's personal preferences

Provision can be formally structured savings plans, generated by the State,
employers or other financial organisations.
Alternatively, individuals can make informal unstructured arrangements.

May use domestic property as an investment to meet retirement needs or they
may benefit from property through inheriting it.

### Financial institutions and other corporations

Vehicle for providing benefits is often provided by financial institutions
either via employer-run schemes or directly to individuals.

Institutions are also proactive in highlighting the need to individuals to make
provision.

Other organisations such as trade unions, credit unions, and charities can also
advise individuals on provision.
