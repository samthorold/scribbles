## Producing a solution

A model must capture the most important features of the actual solution.

The client must be made aware of the uncertainties underlying the model
assumptions.

Types of model

- Commercially produced product
- Modified existing model
- New model

## Construction

- [2018 April Paper 2 Q3](40-2018-04-02.md#3)

Any model should be fit for purpose.

Operational issues

- Documentation
- Easily communicable, with clearly displayed results
- Sensible joint behaviour of variables
- Capable of independent verification
- Not overly complex or time-consuming to run
- Capable of development and refinement
- Capable of being implemented in a range of ways
- Have and appropriate time period between projected cash flows,
balancing reliability of output with the speed of running the model

It is necessary to decide between deterministic and stochastic modelling,
or a combination of the two.
The decision should balance the practical advantages of running a deterministic
model with the increased amount of information produced by a stochastic model.

It is important that the model is dynamic, i.e. that it allows for the
interaction between the parameters and variables affecting the cash flows.

## Developing a model

- Specify the purpose and key features
- Obtain and adjust the data
- Set parameters / assumptions and dynamic links
- Construct the model cash flows
- Check the accuracy and fit of the model and adjust if necessary
- Run the model
- Output and summarise the results

## Use of model for pricing

A model point is a representative policy.
It is normal to identify model points,
which represent homogeneous underlying groups of policies.

The risk discount rate is used to discount the future net cash flows.

The risk discount rate should account for

- Required return
- Level of stastitical risk (assesses analytically, by sensitivity
analysis, from a stochastic model or by comparison with market data)

Alternatively, a stochastic discount rate could be used.

In theory, a different rate could be used for each component of the net
cash flows to allow for the different levels of risk in each cash flow.

In practice, a single rate us used to reflect the average levels of risk.

The premiums / charges resulting from the model need to be considered relative
to the market. Consider

- Product design
- Distribution channels
- Profit requirements
- Size of the market
- Whether to go ahead with the product

The company actuary should also consider the appropriateness of the
premiums / charges given the company's business strategy and capital
requirements.

## Use of models for setting future financing strategies

Modelling techniques are used by benefit schemes to determine future
financing strategies.

The results of the model give the amount and timing of future contributions.

It is acceptable for a scheme to have a deficit as long as the sponsor
covenant is strong enough and there are sufficient assets to meet benefit
outgo as it falls due.

## Use of models in risk management

Models can be used to determine capital requirements to help support risks.

## Use of models for assessing provisions

The valuation of a company's liabilities for regulatory purposes
is likely to be carried out on each individual policy or member,
rather than by using model points.

## Use of models for pricing options and guarantees

Options and guarantees are likely to be priced using a stochastic model,
particularly if linked to an investment outcome.

## Model and parameter error

The results of a model are only as good as the model itself and the choice
of parameter values.

Sensitivity analysis is used to illustrate the potential variability of the
results and to identify the impact of mis-estimation of the parameter values.

Scenario testing involves changing many parameters in combination.

Goodness of fit tests help to reduce model error.

## Alternative ways of allowing for risk

Statistical risk associated with parameter values can be allowed for in the
discount rate and / or by including margins in the parameter values.
