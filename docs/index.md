# Overview

- State the obvious
- Split points into multiple, overlapping sentences
- If in doubt, just go with something and aim for breadth
    - cross-credit is given where qus can reasonably be said to overlap
- Really, state the obvious
- Headers are important, but the marks are not for headers ...
- ... as long as you hit the points, you'll get the marks
- Use the words of the question ...
- ... at least to guide headers

## ACC

!!! note "The Actuarial Control Cycle"

    - Specify the problem
    - Develop the solution
    - Monitor the experience

    In the context of

    - The general commercial and economic environment
    - Professionalism

The actuarial control cycle is a model that can be applied to many aspects of actuarial work.

It helps the user to obtain a clearer understanding of the situation.

**The actuarial control cycle is a fundamental tool of risk management** â€“
the process of analysing, quantifying, mitigating and monitoring risks.

The ACC involves;

- Analyse situations, products, and projects to determine the risks to which they are exposed.
- Quantify the financial consequences of the risk events occurring.
- Consider and quantify appropriate methods of managing, mitigating, or transferring the risks.
- Monitor the situation and the risk management procedures implemented as time develops.
- In the light of experience, modify or change the risk management approaches adopted.

The final bullet point above indicates that the process is cyclical.

The approach used in almost all risk management tasks is that of the actuarial control cycle.
