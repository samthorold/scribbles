## Risk management process

Risk management: the process of ensuring the risks to which an organisation is
exposed are the risks to which it thinks it is exposed and to which it is
prepared to be exposed.

The process consists of

- Identification (of risks and possible controls)
- Classification (including allocation of ownership)
- Control (mitigation of probability, severity, and consequences)
- Financing (determine cost of each risk, including cost effectiveness of risk
controls, and the availability of capital to cover retained risk)
- Monitoring (regular review and re-assessment of risks together with overall
business review to identify new or previously omitted risks)

Risk appetite is an important input here.

### Examples of risk management from qus

The project should be well planned and costed in advance.
Action should be taken at the first sign of overrun and increase in costs.
A fixed fee could be arranged for some of the work.

Investigate to see if planning permission has been given for similar projects
locally (may not be likely) or in other areas.
Could adjust plans if necessary or lobby those with influence.

Investigate background of all contractors,
use tight contract wording and/or penalties.
Could investigate the condition of the proposed sites,
take out insurance for weather, natural disaster risks.

Local knowledge and expertise may be needed and
additional research will need to be conducted.

Additional research relating to the risks in a different country.
Could use derivatives to protect against currency risks.

Research position of other universities and
what the students they are aiming to attract are looking for in a university.

## Risk vs uncertainty

_What on earth is this sentence..._

Risk contains an element of uncertainty but may have some uncertain elements

## Systematic vs diversifiable risk

Systematic risk: affects and entire market or financial system and cannot be
diversified away.

Diversifiable risk: arises from individual component of a market or financial
system and can be diversified away.

Whether a risk is systematic or diversifiable depends on the context.

## Enterprise risk management

A business unit might

- Carry out the same activity in different locations
- Carry out different activities in the same location
- Carry out different activities in different locations
- Operate in different countries
- Operate in different markets
- Be separate companies in a group, which each have their own business units

The parent company could decide its own risk appetite and divide it between the
units.
But, this is unlikely to make an allowance for diversification.
A preferable approach is to establish group risk management as a major activity
at the enterprise level.

Key features of enterprise risk management

- Consistency across business units
- Holistic - consider risks of enterprise as a whole, rather than in isolation,
allowing appropriately for diversification
- Seek opportunities to enhance value

## Stakeholders in risk governance

All members of staff are stakeholders in risk governance in an _efficiently_
run organisation.

Large companies and providers of financial products should have a designated
Chief Risk Officer, normally at the enterprise level.
Business units should also have a risk manager.
