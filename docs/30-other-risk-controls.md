## Diversification

Risk can be managed through diversification within

- Lines of business
    - Just sell something new e.g. motor insurance
- Geographies
- Providers of reinsurance
    - i.e. use more than one in case it fails
- Investments
    - Asset classes
    - Within an asset classes
- Age group
- Policy term
- Purpose of ...
- Number of lives
- Sales channel

Diversification can also be achieved by entering into reciprocal reinsurance
arrangements.

## Underwriting at the proposal stage

### Reasons for initial underwriting

SAFARI

- Suitable special terms
- Avoid anti-selection
- Financial underwriting against over-insurance
- Actual experience in line with that assumed in pricing
- Risk classification / rated fairly
- Identify substandard risks

Underwriting generally refers to the assessment of potential risks so that
each can be charged an appropriate premium.

It can be used to manage risk in the following ways

- Protect a provider from anti-selection
- Enable a provider to classify risks into homogeneous groups for which a
standard premium can be charged and help to ensure that all risks are rated
fairly
- Enables a provider to identify risks for which special terms need to be
quoted
- For substantial risks, the underwriting process identifies the most suitable
approach and level for the special terms to be offered
- For larger proposals, it will help to reduce the risk from over-insurance

Life insurance initial underwriting is likely to involve the following

- Medical underwriting
- Lifestyle underwriting (e.g. occupation, leisure, pursuits, country)
- Financial underwriting

The evidence needs to be interpreted by specialist underwriters.
Special terms may then be applied where the applicant is non-standard

- Addition to premium
- Reduction to benefit
- Exclusion cause
- Decline the applicant (temporarily or permanently)

## Claims control systems

Claims control systems mitigate the consequences of a financial risk that has
occurred by guarding against fraudulent or excessive claims.

eg have a cap on the maximum payout for [peril].

or an excess to reduce the cost of claims.

Or exclusions

For some products (e.g. income protection) claims management continues during
claim.

Strict policy wording

## Management control systems

Have good

- Data recording
- Accounting and auditing
- Monitoring of liabilities taken on
- Management of options and guarantees

Techniques for managing options and guarantees include

- Liability hedging and asset / liability matching including derivatives and
dynamic hedging
- Restricting option eligibility conditions

## Low likelihood, high impact risks

- Diversified only in a limited way
- Transferred to an insurer or reinsurer
- Mitigated by management control procedures e.g. disaster recovery
planning

To determine the capital necessary to hold for such risks and the extent to
which mitigation is necessary, the company will consider its own risk
tolerance e.g. withstand a 0.5% probability risk event over a one year period

## Risk financing

The price accepted for a risk must be adequate, allowing the risk taker to
continue in business and to provide profit.

It is then necessary to determine the amount of capital to hold against the
risks accepted or retained e.g. to target a ruin probability over a specified
period.

Risk management should be co-ordinated to be capital efficient and reduce the
total cost of risk.
