## Advice given

- [2019 April Paper 2 Q1](40-2019-04-02.md#1)

Can provide advice on different types of insurance cover.
May be able to provide a more cost-effective alternative for existing products.

Can advise on other employee benefits including flexible benefits.

Can advise on investment strategy for any reserves and any other projects and also on the defined benefit scheme assets.

Can provide advice relating to tuition fee setting.

Can also provide advice on the identification and management of risks.

Actuaries could work with the other professionals involved in the project
to identify risks involved in the project.

- These risks and their interdependencies can then be discussed
- Each risk could be measured
- General mitigation options can be discussed
- Further risks and mitigation options can then be identified.
This will again involve other relevant professionals.

The actuary can also be involved with plans for outlining how to finance the
project.

The actuary can give more detailed advice relating to risk quantification.
Will need to consider the probability of each risk occurring
and the expected outcome if it does occur.

A subjective assessment could be made estimating the probability
and cost or impact of each risk event on a scale which
could be used for ranking the various risks.

A model could also be used. Would need to assign a distribution to both
the probability of a risk event occurring and the impact of the risk.
Could use a stochastic or deterministic model.
Could provide scenario analysis to assess the impact of the
expansion using different scenarios.

Financial metrics (e.g. NPV, payback period)
could be calculated to assess potential success.

Actuaries could give advice on methods of risk acceptance, rejection,
transfer and management for the various risks involved.

The actuarial control cycle could be used.
