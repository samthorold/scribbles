## Deposit instruments

### Types

- Call deposit: depositor has "instant access" to withdraw funds
- Notice deposit: depositor has to give notice of withdrawal
- Term deposit: depositor has no access to capital before maturity

Interest rates on bank deposits may be fixed or variable.

## Money market instruments

**Short-term**

### Types

- Treasury bills (government)
- Local authority bills (regional government)
- Bills of exchange or commercial paper (companies)

### Main players

- Clearning banks: use money markets to lend excess liquid funds
and borrow when they need short-term funds
- Central banks: act as lenders of last resort,
they stand ready to provide liquidity to the banking system when required,
and who buy and sell bills to establish the level of short-term interest rates
- Other financial institutions and non-financial companies who lend and
borrow short-term funds

### Investment and risk characteristics of cash on deposit and money market

- Secure as short-term, but will depend on the borrower
(borrower because, as an investor, I lend this out for a return)
- All return is through income or capital return that can be considered income
- Level if income has a loose, indirect link with inflation
- Lower expected return than equities or bonds over the long-term]
- Stable market values
- **Short-term**
- Low dealing expenses
- Liquid
- Highly marketable (normally)
- Return normally taxed as income
(even if capital gain?)

### Reasons to hold cash on deposit and money market

Institutions may hold a portion of their funds in deposits and money market

- Meet short-term commitments
- Outgo is uncertain
- Ready to take advantage of other investment opportunities
- Institution has received funds which are awaiting investment in some other
asse class
- Institution needs to protect the monetary value of assets

Institution may hold money market instruments if they are pessimistic about
the performance of other asset classes

- Rising interest rates may cause the value of other assets to fall
- Economic recession where equity and perhaps bond values may fall
- Domestic currency weakens which makes overseas cash more attractive
- General economic uncertainty

## Bonds

A bond is a fixed-interest or index-linked security that is traded on a bond
market.

### Bond markets

- Government bonds listed in their country of origin
- Corporate bonds lised in their country of origin
- Overseas gov and corp bonds listed in countries other than their origin

### Fixed-interest bond

A fixed-interest, or conventional, bond gives an income stream and final
redemption proceeds that are fixed in monetary terms.

#### Characteristics of fixed-interest gov bonds

- Very secure in politically stable countries
- Gross redemption yield is fixed in nominal terms
- Lower expected returns than equities over the long-term
- Market values can be volatile, especially for longer-term bonds
- Mixture of terms; short, medium, long, undated
- Low dealing expenses
- Highly marketable

Corp bonds are generally less

- Secure
- Marketable
- Liquid

Than gov bonds, so investors will require a higher gross redemption yield to
hold them.

#### Nominal yield on fixed-interest bond

Nominal yield = risk-free real yield + expected future inflation + inflation
risk premium

## Index-linked bonds

An index-linked bond gives an income stream and final redemption proceeds that
are linked to an inflation index.

## Relative attractiveness of fixed interest vs index-linked bonds

An investor whose expectation for future inflation is lower than that implied
by the difference between nominal and real yields in the market will find
fixed-interest bonds more attractive than index-linked bonds and vice versa.
