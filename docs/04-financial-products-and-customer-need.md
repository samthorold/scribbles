## Customer needs

Important to differentiate between a customer's

- Logical vs emotional needs
- Current vs future needs

Logical needs can be analysed as follows

- Maintaining a current lifestyle
- Protection
- Accumulation for a purpose
- Accumulation for a purpose as yet unknown

Emotional needs are not identified in such a methodical way but are the result
of what a customer thinks is needed or wants (rather than needs).

Current vs future needs

A current need is triggered by an event that has an immediate effect on a
customer's circumstances e.g. protection against sickness.

A future need may be one that relates to a customer's future aspirations e.g.
to retire at a certain age.

### Logical needs of individuals

- Living expenses
    - e.g. food and transport
    - current
    - real
- Purchasing a house
    - current
- Saving for retirement
- Protection from injury and illness
