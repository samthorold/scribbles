        - Chinese walls
        - Cooling off periods

Regime | Pros | Cons
---|---|---
**Unregulated markets**<br/>No regulations imposed. |+ No cost.<br/>+ May encourage innovation in the industry.|- No protection for customers and therefore risks sub-optimal outcomes for them.<br/>- Low level of market confidence.<br/>- Reliant on companies behaving appropriately.
**Voluntary codes of conduct**<br/>Companies choose whether they follow the regulation. |+ Can be effective in providing protection for consumers for some markets.<br/>+ More cost effective than statutory regulation.|- Exposed to rogue operators who choose not to comply.
**Self-regulation**<br/>Regulation and compliance are operated by the market participants.|+ Costs likely to be lower than statutory regulation.<br/>+ Undertaken by the experts who understand the industry.<br/>+ These experts have the incentive to optimise cost vs effectiveness.<br/>+ May lead to increased innovation.|- Lack of independence and so a risk of loss of consumer confidence (but better than unregulated).<br/>- Regulator is very close to the market, so may be perceived to be, or actually be, weak.<br/>- Relies on whistle blowers to highlight inappropriate behaviour.
**Statutory regulation**<br/>The government or regulator sets down the rules to be followed.|+ Greatest market confidence.<br/>+ Should be less open to abuse and ensure fair markets.<br/>+ Ensures a level playing field, as all companies subject to the rules.|- Likely highest costs<br/>- May stifle innovation.
**Mixed**<br/>Combination of the other regimes. |+ Can help ensure that the appropriate level of regulation is applied to different sectors.|- Requires co-operation between those providing the different types of regulation.

Each of these regimes can adopt any of the following forms

- Prescriptive: detailed rules
- Freedom of action: rules only on publicity of information
- Outcome-based: prescribed tolerated outcomes

## Role of major financial institutions

Major financial institutions support the regulatory framework

- Central bank: controls or influences economic variables and is a lender of
last resort
- State intervention: provide products and control premium rates
- Larger market participants:
    - influence rates
    - allow smaller participants to find niche markets
    - but, may distort the  market and use up too much of the regulator's
    resources
