## Equities

An ordinary share is a share in the ownership of the company.

- Security depends on profitability of company
- Provides long-term real yield i.e. returns tend to move in line with infl
- Higher expected returns than gov bonds over the long-term
- Income (dividends) and capital values (prices) can be volatile
- Can generally be held in perpetuity
- Dealing expenses are linked to marketability
- Marketability depends on the size of the company

**Quoted shares** are listed on a stock exchange and make up the majority of
available equity investment.
Quoted shares are generally

- More marketable
- More secure
- Easier to value

than non-quoted shares.

### Industry groupings

- Practical for analysts to specialise in one area
    - Factors affecting one company in an industry are likely to be relevant
    to other companies in the same industry
    - Much of the information for companies in the same industry will come from
    a common source and will be presented in a similar way
    - No one analyst can expect to be an expert in all areas, so specialism is
    appropriate
    - The grouping of equities according to some common factor gives structure
    to the decision-making process - it assists in portfolio classification and
    management
- Share prices of companies in the same sector tend to be correlated
    - Same resources and so similar cost of inputs
    - Supply to similar markets and so are similarly affected by changes in
    demand
    - (Similar financial structures and so are similarly affected by changes to
    interest rates)

## Property

A **PRIME** property

| Call | St |
|---|---|
| Comparables (number of) | Size |
| Age, condition, flexibility of usage | Tenant quality |
| Location | |
| Lease structure | |

Comparables

- gauge whether price is realistic

Age, condition, flexibility of usage

- if the property is in good repair it will attract higher rent
- poor condition - additional expenses to repair / improve condition
- appropriate certificates e.g. boiler, engery efficieny
- attractive to a range of renants? Flexible enough to split into multiple units
- the greater the flexibility, the higher the level of rent,
and the lower the chance of voids

Location

- exact location key
- socio-economic conditions in the location
- proximity to university (or similar point related to qu)
- exposure of property to natural risks e.g. floods, subsidence

Lease structure

- property has existing tenants (or similar related to qu)
- restrictions in the deeds

Size

- larger - more expensive
- more options

Tenant qual

- type you wish to attract
- and type of property attractive to that tenant
- balance level of rent / average length of lease
- with risk of voids

Further

- Void and default risk
- Interest rate risk - rise in interest rates increases cost of variable mort
- Financial and emotional cost of evicting tenant
- Obsolescence
- Deterioration
- Refurbishment costs
- Susceptible to political risk
- Long-term real returns i.e. move in line with inflation
- Expected higher return than that on index-linked gov bonds
- Stepped income stream
- Running yield varies with type of property
- Can provide high utility (feel good factor) to the investor
- Long-term volatility of capital values but short-term stability due to
infrequent valuations
- High dealing costs
- High management costs
- Insurance cost
- Maintenance cost
- Possibility for characteristics to be changed by the investor e.g.
redevelopment
- Unmarketable
- Large unit size
- Indivisibility
- Uniqueness
- Subjective valuations

### Freehold and leasehold

The freeholder of a property is the absolute owner of it in perpetuity.
The freeholder can let the property to a third party (a leaseholder) in return
for an annual ground rent.

Compared with freehold investment, a leasehold is shorter-term and provides
higher initial rental yield and capital loss if the lease is held to
termination date

### Indirect property

Indirect investments in pooled property funds and property share companies
may also be available.
They help overcome some of the key problems with direct property investment
(e.g. lack of marketability and large indivisible units).
But they have their own problems.
Key issues to consider with direct vs indirect property investment

- Control
- Discount to net asset value
- Diversification
- Divisibility
- Expenses
- Expertise
- Marketability
- Valuation
