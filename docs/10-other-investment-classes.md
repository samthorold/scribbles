## Collective investment schemes

CISs provide the opportunity for investors to achieve a wide spread of
investmets whilst benefitting from specialsit management expertise.

Regulation of CISs typically covers

- Categories of assets that can be held
- Whether unquoted assets can be held
- Max gearing
- Any tax relief

### Closed-ended CIS

For example, an **investment trust**.
Once the initial tranche of money has been invested,
the fund is closed to new money.

- Stated investment objective
- Key players
    - Board of directors
    - Investment managers
    - Shareholders
- Investors buy shares in an investment trust company,
with the price determined by supply and demand
- Share price is often at a discount to net asset value per share
- Funds are closed-ended
- As public companies, they are governed by company law
- Gearing allowed

### Open-ended CIS.

For example, a **unit trust** or **open-ended investment company**.
Managers can create or cancel units in the fund as new money is invested or
disinvested.

- Stated investment objective
- Key players
    - Trustees (e.g. insurance company or bank)
    - Management company (incl. investment managers)
    - Unitholders
- Investors buy units which are priced at net asset value per unit
- Funds are open-ended
- As trusts, they are governed by trust law
- Limited power to use gearing

### Differences between open-ended and closed-ended funds

- Investments in closed-ended funds are typically less marketable than the
underlying assets, whereas the marketability of investments in open-ended
funds is guaranteed by the managers
- Closed-ended funds can gear, leading to extra volatility whereas open-ended
funds have limited power to gear
- It may be possible to buy assets at less than NAV in a closed-ended fund
- Higher volatility of closed-ended fund implies higher expected return
- Shares in closed-ended funds are more volatile than the underlying assets
because the size of any discount to NAV can change. The volatility of units
in an open-ended fund should be similar to that of the underlying assets
- There may be uncertainty as to the true level of NAV in a closed-ended fund,
especially if the investments are unquoted
- Closed-ended funds can invest in a wider range of assets
- May be subject to different tax treatment
