## Collective investment schemes

CISs provide the opportunity for investors to achieve a wide spread of
investmets whilst benefitting from specialsit management expertise.

Regulation of CISs typically covers

- Categories of assets that can be held
- Whether unquoted assets can be held
- Max gearing
- Any tax relief

### Closed-ended CIS

For example, an **investment trust**.
Once the initial tranche of money has been invested,
the fund is closed to new money.

- Stated investment objective
- Key players
    - Board of directors
    - Investment managers
    - Shareholders
- Investors buy shares in an investment trust company,
with the price determined by supply and demand
- Share price is often at a discount to net asset value per share
- Funds are closed-ended
- As public companies, they are governed by company law
- Gearing allowed

### Open-ended CIS.

For example, a **unit trust** or **open-ended investment company**.
Managers can create or cancel units in the fund as new money is invested or
disinvested.

- Stated investment objective
- Key players
    - Trustees (e.g. insurance company or bank)
    - Management company (incl. investment managers)
    - Unitholders
- Investors buy units which are priced at net asset value per unit
- Funds are open-ended
- As trusts, they are governed by trust law
- Limited power to use gearing

### Differences between open-ended and closed-ended funds

- Investments in closed-ended funds are typically less marketable than the
underlying assets, whereas the marketability of investments in open-ended
funds is guaranteed by the managers
- Closed-ended funds can gear, leading to extra volatility whereas open-ended
funds have limited power to gear
- It may be possible to buy assets at less than NAV in a closed-ended fund
- Higher volatility of closed-ended fund implies higher expected return
- Shares in closed-ended funds are more volatile than the underlying assets
because the size of any discount to NAV can change. The volatility of units
in an open-ended fund should be similar to that of the underlying assets
- There may be uncertainty as to the true level of NAV in a closed-ended fund,
especially if the investments are unquoted
- Closed-ended funds can invest in a wider range of assets
- May be subject to different tax treatment

### CIS vs direct investment

Advantages of CIS

- Access to expertise
- do not need to establish team
    - which takes time and money
    - and in that time you are not able to invest
- Diversification
- can use a manager with a proven track record
- lower key-person risk if manager is large
- Some direct costs of investment are avoided
- Holdings are divisible
- Possible tax advantages
- Marketability may be better than that of the underlying

Disadvantages

- Loss of control
- Management charges incurred
- Possible tax disadvantages
- additional operational and external risks
- does not remove the need for some expertise
    - carry out initial due diligence on the investment manager
    - set a risk appetite and investment mandate
    - carry out ongoing oversight and review of the investment manager and the asset held
    - set up capital models and calibration for economic and statutory capital

#### Advantages of indirect investment

A wide range of skills and experience is required to invest in commercial mortgages.

Setting up such a team involves significant costs ...

... whereas the third-party manager can benefit from economies of scale.

Setting up such a team would take up a lot of LifeCo’s time ...

... delaying LifeCo from investing in commercial mortgages.

LifeCo can select an investment manager with a proven track record.

Indirect investment makes it easier to achieve diversification, as LifeCo can be invested in a larger number (but smaller proportion) of loans.

#### Disadvantages of indirect investment

Indirect investment gives less control over the loans chosen.

Indirect investment exposes LifeCo to additional operational and external risks.

Use of a third-party manager does not remove the need for the LifeCo to have expertise in loans.

## Derivatives

Derivative - financial instrument with value dependent on value of some other
underlying asset

Long and asset - positive economic exposure to that asset

## Overseas investment

### Pros

[2019 April Paper 1 Q7-i](40-2019-04-01.md#7-i)

The overseas [assets] may be more secure, i.e. have lower [default] risk.

#### Match liabilities in foreign currency

The scheme may have some liabilities denominated in the currency of the other country ...

... so holding these bonds gives a better match.

Bonds of a longer term, appropriate to match the scheme’s liabilities, may be available in the other country.

#### Higher expected returns

There may be price inefficiencies ...

... which the scheme may be able to exploit.

There may be beneficial tax treatment, which increases returns.

The overall return achieved may be higher despite the lower yield if:

- yields are expected to fall further (and so prices rise) ...
- ... and so a capital gain is made (assuming the bonds are sold before maturity)
- the currency moves favourably ...
- ... ie the currency in Country B appreciates vs that of Country A.

#### Reduce risk by increasing level of diversification

There may be diversification benefits from investing overseas.

Diversifying reduces exposure to specific risks ...

... e.g. risks specific to the economy of the domestic country.

### Cons

- Mismatching risk due to different foreign market performance compated to
domestic market
- Currency fluctuation risk
- Cost of obtaining expertise
- Additional admin; custodian, dividend tracking and collection
- Possible tax disadvantages e.g. withholding tax
- Different accounting practices
- Lack of good quality information
- Language problems
- Possible time delays
- Poorly regulated markets
- Political risks e.g. confiscation of assets
- Possible lack of liquidity
- Restrictions on ownership of shares by foreign investors

#### Investment difficulties

Mismatching domestic liabilities

Taxation (may not be able to recover withholding taxes paid)

Volatility of currency

#### Practical problems

Custodian needed

Additional admin required

Time delays

Expenses / Expertise required

Regulation (poor)

Political instability

Information harder to obtain / less plentiful

Language difficulties

Liquidity problems

Accounting differences

Restrictions on foreign ownership / repatriation problems

### Indirect overseas investment

- Multinational companies based in the domestic country
- CIS specialising in overseas investment
- Derivatives based on overseas markets

## Emerging markets

Stock markets in countries with developing economies.

High growth rates and possible market inefficiencies,
opportunities for big gains and losses.

Economies and markets of many smaller countries are less interdependent
than those of major economic powers, this provides good diversification.

Factors to consider

- Current market valuation
- Possibility of high economic growth rate
- Currency stability and strength
- Level of marketability
- Degree of poilitical stability
- Market regulation
- Restrictions on foreign investment
- Range of companies available
- Communication problems
- Availability and quality of information
