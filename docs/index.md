# Overview

- State the obvious
- Split points into multiple, overlapping sentences
- Try to find the one or two sentence overarching theme ...
- ... at least to guide the headers.
    - risk v reward
    - aims of gov't / regl
    - ACC
    - Risk mgmt
- include lots of points, but not much detail on each
- If in doubt, just go with something and aim for breadth
    - cross-credit is given where qus can reasonably be said to overlap
- Really, state the obvious
- Headers are important, but the marks are not for headers ...
- ... as long as you hit the points, you'll get the marks
- Use the words of the question ...
- ... at least to guide headers

!!! note "The Actuarial Control Cycle"

    - Specify the problem
    - Develop the solution
    - Monitor the experience

    In the context of

    - The general commercial and economic environment
    - Professionalism

The actuarial control cycle is a model that can be applied to many aspects of actuarial work.

It helps the user to obtain a clearer understanding of the situation.

**The actuarial control cycle is a fundamental tool of risk management** â€“
the process of analysing, quantifying, mitigating and monitoring risks.

The ACC involves;

- Analyse situations, products, and projects to determine the risks to which they are exposed.
- Quantify the financial consequences of the risk events occurring.
- Consider and quantify appropriate methods of managing, mitigating, or transferring the risks.
- Monitor the situation and the risk management procedures implemented as time develops.
- In the light of experience, modify or change the risk management approaches adopted.

The final bullet point above indicates that the process is cyclical.

The approach used in almost all risk management tasks is that of the actuarial control cycle.

### General economic and commercial environment

It will be important to consider the wider external environment ...

... e.g. who the key competitors are, their products and prices.

Consider the regulations applying to pricing and reserving for [this product].

### Specifying the problem

Measurable targets will need to be set, eg

- profit criteria
- market share.

All the stakeholders will need to be identified e.g.

- reinsurers
- regulator

Risk will need to be identified e.g. COMBEL, PNEFCPB

- mortality heavier than expected
- expenses greater than expected
- business volumes lower than expected
- inadequate underwriting.

Risks will then be analysed.

[As the product is new, ]the insurer may lack expertise in pricing the product for this market.

The initial problem is to [design and price the new term assurance].

### Developing the solution

Risks will need to be managed, mitigated or transferred.

A model will be required to [price the product].

Assumptions will need to be set.

[As this is term assurance, mortality] is the key assumption.

Decisions will be made in relation to handling risks.

An analysis of various design options will be undertaken.

### Monitoring the experience

Actual experience will need to be reviewed against expectations.

[For example, assessing the success of using tied agents as opposed to other sales channels.]

The following areas will be monitored:

- mortality, which may vary significantly over time [in a developing country ]...

    ... and this mortality risk will sit entirely with the insurer if the contract is without-profit in nature.

- lapses
- business volumes
- performance relative to competitors.

### Professionalism

All work should be undertaken in a professional manner.
