Group policies are characterised by:

- only covering employees whilst they work for the company (ie benefit ceases on leaving or retirement)
- limited underwriting
- concentrations of exposure, eg by type of work and location
- often being compulsory or opt out, ie all employees join automatically.


## Pure endowment and endowment assurance

Pure endowment provides a benefit on survival to a known date
and so operates as a savings vehicle.
For example, to provide a lump sum on retirement,
or a means of repaying a loan.

Endowment assurance also provides a significant benefit on the death before
the date and so operates as a vehicle for providing protection for
dependents.

## Whole life assurance

Provides a benefit on death whenever that might occur.

## Term assurance

Provides a benefit on death provided it occurs within the date.
Do not normally have any benefit on withdrawal.

## Convertible or renewable term assurance

Combine a term assurance with the certainty of being able either to convert
to a permanent form of contract (endowment or whole life assurance) or to
renew the original contract for a further period, all without further
evidence of health being provided (unless the level of benefit is increased).

## Immediate annuity

A single premium purchasing an income stream which commences immediately
after purchase.

## Deferred annuity

Can be used when there is time between the date of purchase and the date when
the income is required to start (vesting date).
The contract can be paid for either by a single premium of by regular premiums
during the deferred period.

## Income drawdown

Leave the accumulated pension fund at retirement invested and draw an income
from it each year.
There may be limits on how much can be drawn down each year and an age limit
at which point an annuity must be purchased.

## Investment bond

Single premium invested for the whole life or a fixed term.
Benefit depends on investment returns during the period of investment.
Funds can be withdrawn but this may incur surrender penalties,
particularly at early durations.
There may be a guarantee offered on death.

## Income protection insurance

Enables individuals to provide an income for themselves and their
dependents during periods of long-term sickness or incapacity due to
accident or illness.
Such contracts typically terminate at retirement age.

## Critical illness insurance

Lump sum on diagnosis of a critical illness as defined by the policy
documents.

## Keyperson cover

Lump sum on death or critical illness of a key individual within a
business.
Benefit may be linked to loss of profits or the salary of the
individual and used to buy out the individual from the business or
find a replacement.

## Long-term care insurance

Helps to provide financial security against the risk of needing
either home or nursing home care as an elderly persion i.e. post
retirement.

## Investment types

Main life insurance policy investment types are

- Without-profit: benefit amount or method of calc specified
- With-profit: benefit involves share in the surplus of the company
- Unit-linked: benefit depends on the value of a unit fund
- Index-linked: benefit depends on a specified index

### Without-profit (non-participating) contracts

A life insurance contract is without-profit if the life insurance company has no discretion over the amount of benefit payable ...

... i.e. the policy document will specify at outset either the amount of the benefits under the contract or how they will be calculated.

**The key feature of without-profit business is its guaranteed, non-discretionary nature.**

A customer knows, at outset, what both their premiums and benefits will be.

Strictly, only the main benefits may be fixed ...

... for example the death and maturity benefits may be fixed ...

... but the surrender value may be at the discretion of the life insurance company.

**Without-profit contracts tend to be most appropriate when the primary customer need is protection.**

Broadly, this certainty means less risk for the policyholder than on a with-profit or unit-linked contract.

### With-profit (participating) contracts

[2019 September Paper 1 Q4](40-2019-09-01.md#4)

- there will be a guaranteed minimum benefit
- regular bonuses will be added during the lifetime of the policy
- a terminal bonus will be added when the benefit payment is made.

The payment of the bonuses will depend on the performance of the with-profit fund, primarily on investment returns and on the wider performance of the insurer, as well as the bonuses that have already been awarded on the product.

The insurer has discretion in awarding future bonuses, although once a regular bonus has been added to a policy it is guaranteed. The insurer does need to be mindful though of policyholder expectations, which will depend upon any literature provided, past practice of the insurer and what other insurers are providing on similar policies.

The insurer will usually aim to smooth bonuses by "holding back" some money when the fund is performing very well, so as to be able to provide it as bonuses in other years when the fund has performed poorly.

A life insurance contract is with-profit if the policyholder is entitled to receive part of the surplus of the company or of a sub-fund within the company.

The extent of the entitlement is usually at the discretion of the company.

Without-profit contracts do not have this profit participation feature.

Under a with-profit contract, the insurer and the policyholder share the profits (and hence the risks).

A wide range of with-profit contracts is available.

**They tend to be most appropriate when the customer need that the contract is addressing is saving.**

Savings contracts will tend to have premiums invested in riskier assets than do without-profit contracts ...

... with higher expected returns that are used to form the basis of the discretionary benefit entitlement.

**It is typical for a with-profit contract to involve some guaranteed benefits and some discretionary.**

There are a variety of ways of applying the discretionary benefit ...

... including the additions to benefit approach illustrated below.

The factors that come into play, when setting levels of bonus include:

- the wish to smooth benefits from year to year, so keeping back some of the profit from the good years, to help in the bad years
- policyholder expectations, e.g. based on past bonus distributions by the company
- looking at what competitors are doing adhering
- to regulatory limits on payouts.

A 20-year conventional with-profit endowment assurance has a benefit comprising:

- a guaranteed sum assured of £20,000
- regular bonuses of 3% compound per year
- a terminal bonus of 25% of the guaranteed sum assured plus regular bonuses.

The maturity benefit is given by:

\[
£20,000 \times 1.03^{20} \times 1.25 = £45,153
\]

The insurance company would decide on the level of regular bonuses each year.

They may not necessarily always be 3%.

Once the regular bonuses are declared, they become part of the guaranteed element of the policy.

At the end of year 1, the guaranteed benefit increases to:

\[
£20,000 \times 1.03 = £20,600
\]

This doesn’t mean that the policyholder receives £600 at the end of year 1 ...

... rather that the benefit to which they are entitled on maturity has risen to £20,600.

### Unit-linked contracts

Unit-linked contracts are unitised contracts whose value of units is directly attributable to the underlying value of the invested assets.

Unit-linked contracts operate by paying policyholder premiums into pooled investment funds.

Often the policyholder has a choice of funds.

The policyholder’s share of the fund is represented by units.

Any of the types of contract can be written in a unit-linked form ...

... although normally only contracts with a significant investment element are written in this way.

The benefit payable at maturity depends on the performance of the underlying assets ...

... and the level of charges levied by the insurance company.

This is the investment, or savings, element of the contract.

A protection element of the contract may also exist. For example, the benefit on death might be:

- a fixed sum (eg £50,000), or
- the value of units, or
- some percentage (eg 120%) of the value of units.

This makes unit-linked policies very versatile.

If the first option is chosen ...

... with a very high sum assured (relative to the premium) ...

... then the contract can be almost entirely protection in nature.

The policyholder will typically be charged for this protection cover via regular charge deductions (e.g. a monthly mortality charge) from his/her unit fund.

**From the insurer’s perspective**, the profit comes from

- the expense charges less the actual expenses and
- the mortality charge less the cost of providing any guaranteed death benefit.

Therefore, the key risk to the life insurer is that the charges do not match the expenses / cost of guarantee in terms of nature, timing and amount.

A unit-linked contract enables consumers either to obtain a higher expected level of benefit for a given premium ...

... or to pay a lower expected level of premium for a given level of benefit ...

... than under a comparable non-linked version of the contract.

This occurs because the consumer accepts a significant element of risk, mostly investment risk.

By accepting greater risk ...

... the consumer gains a higher **expected** return ...

... at the expense of a possibility that the return will be lower than might have been achieved from a non-linked contract.

!!! note ""

    The word "expected" is important here.

    While the expected maturity value might be higher under a unit-linked contract ...

    ... the actual maturity value could be lower.

    This is what is meant by the policyholder taking more risk.

In addition, a unit-linked contract can offer flexibility in the types and levels of cover included and the ability to vary premiums according to need.

### Explain how the consumer accepts a greater element of the risk under unit-linked contracts than under with-profit contracts.

Under a typical unit-linked contract, all the investment risk lies with the consumer ...

... as investment performance directly affects the value of the unit fund and hence the main benefit.

Under a typical with-profit contract, less investment risk lies with the consumer because:

- There is still a guaranteed element to the benefit that the insurance company must meet.
- Policyholder expectations may limit the scope and speed of bonus reductions.

    These are at the discretion of the company rather than being "automatic" as with the value of the unit-linked contract.

- It is possible that shareholders (where there are any) share in the investment losses (as well as profits) of the company.

### Index-linked contracts

An index-linked contract enables the consumer to obtain a benefit that is guaranteed to move in line with the performance of an index specified in the contract.

Normally the index will be an investment or economic one.

Premiums may move in line with the same index, or may be fixed in monetary terms.

Suitable investment indices might be the major domestic equity market indices of any country, or more broadly based international equity indices.

Also links might be made to other asset classes such as fixed interest.

Typical economic indices that might be used include retail or other appropriate price indices.
