## Personal data

Information that would allow an individual to be identified,
either on its own or when combined with other information.
Organisations have ethical and legislative responsibilities when dealing with
personal data.

## Big data

Big data refers to very large data sets of information.

It can be characterised by

- Very large data sets.
- Data brought together from different sources.
- Data which can be analysed very quickly for real time decision making.

### Challenges

Big data can include personal data
(such as data from social media or loyalty cards).

If personal data is held by an organisation,
then the organisation needs to comply with the relevant data protection rules.

Given the large amount of information that could be held on an individual,
privacy considerations are likely to be a concern for individuals whose data is
held.

There may be challenges collecting data from many different
sources and analysing them.
There may also be difficulties with data storage and/or computer power.

It may be difficult to pick up any errors or missed data.

Anonymization can potentially aid big data analytics.
It also enables organisations to give an assurance to the people whose data was
collected that they are not using data that identifies them for big data
analytics.

A key feature of big data is using ‘all’ the data,
which contrasts with the concept of data minimisation in the data protection
principles.
This raises questions about whether big data is excessive,
while the variety of data sources often used in big data analytics may also
prompt questions over whether the personal information being used is relevant.

Organisations need to be clear from the outset what they expect to learn or be
able to achieve by processing the data,
as well as satisfying themselves that the data is relevant and not excessive.

Need to ensure that data is ethically and fairly used and complies with all
regulation.

Data governance is becoming increasingly important for holders of big data.

### Uses

_In this case, for a university_

Big data can be used to monitor student performance and attendance 
(but not on an individual level)
to check which areas are working and to identify problem areas
e.g types of students, courses, modules, methods of assessment.

This should ensure the university can keep their current students 
(reduce drop outs)
and increase future student numbers.

Should also enable them to increase student satisfaction.

And identify the best quality courses.

It can be used for marketing purposes.

This should help them achieve financial and academic success.

It can also be used for academic research.

## Data governance

The overall management of the
availability, usability, integrity, and security of data.

Organisations should have in place a robust data governance policy.
Failure to do so can lead to legal, operational, reputational and expense risks.

Data governance is a key issue during a merger or acquisition.

## Data risks

QUERIED

- Inaccurate or incomplete
- Not credible due to insuffient volume, particularly in the extremes
- Not relevant for the intended purpose
- Past data may not reflect what will happen in the future
- Chosen data groups may not be optimal
- Not available in an appropriate form for the intended purpose

## Algorithmic decision making

Automated asset trading is an example of where data and model risk arises.

## Data requirements

Actuaries use data for setting premiums / contributions, valuing provisions, and
experience analyses.

Ideally, the data should be controlled through on single, integrated system.

Main sources of data are;

- Public data
- Internal data

## Data quality

Poor data can be due to

- Poor management control of data recording or its verification process
- Poor design of the data systems

A well-designed proposal form will contain unambiguous questions to help
ensure correct answers are collected from policyholders.

For life insurance policies, the proposal form should capture the relevant
underwriting information.

For general insurance policies, it should capture the relevant rating factors.

The information on both the proposal and claim forms must be easy to enter into
the system.

The system must be able to link across proposal and claims records.

## Data issues for employee benefit schemes

Information is provided by the sponsor, rather than being under the direct
control of the actuary.

## Checks on data

Past data can be used to help verify current data.

Accounting data is useful to help verify income and outgo and the value of
assets.
Data on individual assets should also be checked.

The actuary will make assertions as to the quality of the data.

These assertions will be checked by looking at;

- Reconciliations of member / policy numbers
- Reconciliations of benefits and premiums
- Movement data against accounts
- Validity of dates
- Consistency of contribution and benefit levels with accounts
- Consistency between average sum assured and premium for each class,
and when compared with previous investigations
- Consistency of asset income data and accounts
- Reconciliation of beneficial owner and custodian records where assets are
owned by a third party
- Full deed audit for certain assets e.g. property
- Consistency between start and end period shareholdings
- Records picked at random for spot checks

## Lack of ideal data

Main circumstances under which data are not available;

- Insuffient volume to provide credibility
- Data not captured with suffient detail

Summarised data is not suitable for valuing options and guarantees on an
individual basis.

## Industry-wide data collection schemes

Industry-wide data is suitable for setting bases but not for valuing an
individual policy.

Care needs to be taken as this data can be hetergeneous.
Due to;

- Companies operate in different geographical or socio-economic sections of the
market
- Policies sold by different companies are not identical
- Sales methods are not identical
- Companies will have different practices e.g. underwriting, claim settlement
- Nature of the data stored by will not always be the same
- Coding used for risk factors may vary

In addition;

- Data may be less detailed / flexible
- Data may be out of date
- Data qualitt may be poor
- Not all organisations contribute and those that do may not be representative
of the market as a whole

Data may also be obtained from reinsurers or from national statistics.

## Risk classification and reduction heterogeneity

Aim is to have homogeneous data as hetergeneity distorts results.

Removal of heterogeneity needs to be balanced against having sufficient data in
each group to ensure credibility.
