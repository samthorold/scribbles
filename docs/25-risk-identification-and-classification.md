## Risk identification

- [2020 September Paper 1 Q4i](40-2020-09-01.md#4-i)

Risk identification is the first step of the risk management control cycle.

Risk identification is the recognition of the risks that can threaten an organisation's business plan.

For each risk identified it is necessary to determine any risk control processes that can be put in place which will reduce either the likelihood of the risk event occurring or the impact of the risk event should it occur.

It is also important to identify opportunities to exploit risks and gain a competitive advantage over other providers.

Taking on risk is a potential source of profit if the risk is priced correctly.

Identifying all the risks in an organisation is a difficult task and requires good knowledge of;

- the circumstances of the organisation concerned
- the features of the business environment in which it operates
- the general business and regulatory environment.

This is equivalent to needing to consider the external environment when following the actuarial control cycle.

Not all risks are immediately obvious.

In particular, it may be difficult to identify newly emerging risks ...

... and other risks that have not yet been experienced by the company but which have the potential to occur.

### Risk identification techniques

!!! note "Explain who should be involved in identifying the risks that could arise within an organisation."

    It is important that everyone involved in an organisation is involved in risk identification ...

    ... not just management and not just those employees who work in a dedicated risk management team.

    This is because those who work directly within the business (e.g. customer service teams) ...

    ... and who use the processes on a regular basis are often most likely to be able to spot potential risk areas.

    It is also useful to involve individuals who are external to the organisation.

    In particular, experts may be used to assist with those risks that are more difficult to identify.

    This could include new types of emerging risk and risks that have a low likelihood (and therefore the organisation will have no or limited experience of them) but potentially high impact.

    External stakeholders can also be involved.

    For example, organisations can encourage their customers to report risks that they come across in using the companyâ€™s products or visiting its premises.

To complete a full identification of risks requires gaining input from everyone involved in the business, at all levels.

Senior management may not be aware of a weakness in an operational process that is a risk to the business, which the more junior operators of the process could readily identify.

There are some techniques available to ensure that all relevant risks have been identified;

- use risk classification (see next section) to ensure that all types of risk have been considered
- use techniques from project management as described in the next sub-section
- use risk checklists, for example as used for regulatory purposes (see below)
- use the experience of staff who have joined from similar organisations, and of consultants with broad experience of the industry concerned.

#### Risk checklists

Where there is a risk-based capital requirement regime, such as Solvency II in Europe, there may be lists of risks that regulators believe are relevant to the business.

For example, the standard formula for calculating capital requirements covers many risks relevant to financial product providers.

Such lists may not be exhaustive.

For example, the Solvency II standard formula does not include equity volatility as a risk, which could be highly relevant to a business offering equity-backed products with point guarantees (guaranteed investment at a specified point in time - unit-linked product).

#### Risks in project management

**Identification and analysis of risks**

The steps necessary to achieve an effective identification and analysis of the risks facing a project can be summarised as follows;

- Make a high-level preliminary risk analysis to confirm that the project does not have such a high-risk profile that it is not worth analysing further - in which case, the project should not proceed.
- Hold a brainstorming session of project experts and senior internal and external people who are used to thinking strategically about the long term. The aim will be to:
    - identify project risks, both likely and unlikely, and their upsides and downsides
    - discuss these risks and their interdependency
    - attempt to place a broad initial evaluation on each risk, considering both frequency of occurrence and probable consequences if it does occur
    - generate initial mitigation options
    - discuss these options briefly.
- Carry out a desktop analysis to supplement the results from the brainstorming session, by identifying further risks and mitigation options, e.g. by researching similar projects undertaken by the sponsor or others in the past (including overseas experiences).
- Obtain the considered opinions of experts who are familiar with the details of the project and the outline plans for financing it.
- Carefully set out all the identified risks in a risk register or a risk matrix, with cross-references to other risks where there is interdependency.

    High levels of correlation between individual risks will lead to a higher overall variance of the returns from the project, as the individual risks are less likely to cancel each other out.

A risk matrix is a very useful tool for the risk analyst because it acts as a reminder to consider particular types of risk, which may not have been sufficiently considered.

It may be linked to the use of risk checklists, and also provides a convenient categorisation for risks.

The cells in the matrix can be ticked off to show whether the risk in question applies to the particular project, with a cross-reference to the appropriate entry in the risk register.

The rows in a risk matrix represent the stage of the project at which the risk arises. The columns represent the causes (or types) of risk.

Project management risk identification techniques

- Firstly carry out a high level preliminary analysis

    with the aim of checking whether the project is so risky that it should not proceed.

- Hold a brainstorming session

    with experts both internal and external to the business.

- Carry out a desktop analysis

    with further research on risks arising from the brainstorming session and starting to consider mitigation options.

- Compile the risks into a risk register or risk matrix

    detailing frequency, severity and correlations between risks.

### Market risk

Related to changes in investment market values or other features correlated with investment markets.

- Changes in asset values
- Investment market value changes on liabilities - due to change in inflation / interest rates
    - amount - higher interest rate -> higher pincs / unit value
    - value / provisions - lower interest rate -> lower discount rate used to value liabilities and therefore require higher provisions

- Mismatching assets and liabilities

!!! note "Likely effect of an increase in short-term interest rates on value"

    Fixed-interest bonds: An increase in short-term interest rates will almost certainly cause prices of short-term bonds to fall. The values of long-term bonds may go up or down depending on investors' views on future levels of inflation and monetary policy.

    Index-linked bonds: If higher short-term interest rates are interpreted as a sign of lower expected future inflation, then demand for index-linked bonds, and so their values, might fall.

    Equities: Higher interest rates might depress economic growth and so equity values might fall.

    Property: Higher real interest rates should lead to a lower valuation of future rents and therefore lower capital values of property.

#### Asset / Liability matching

The fundamental principle of investment is that assets should be selected to match the liabilities in nature, term and currency.

If it were possible to find such a perfect match, then market risk could be completely diversified away by choosing a matched portfolio.

In practice a perfect match may be impossible because:

- there may not be a wide enough range of assets available ...

    ... in particular it is unusual to find assets of long enough duration

- liabilities may be uncertain in amount and timing
- liabilities may include options and hence have uncertain cashflows after the option date
- liabilities may include discretionary benefits
- the cost of maintaining a fully-matched portfolio is likely to be prohibitive.

Hence even a well-matched portfolio is likely to retain some element of risk.

The existence of additional capital gives freedom to intentionally take an unmatched position in the hope of achieving an additional return.

The capital will be used to cover the cost of the risk taken.

Interest rate rises will be a particular concern if the [company's] source of finance is at a variable rate.

Interest rates may rise ...

... but as the bank cannot change the rate on existing [product] ...

... it may miss out on earning returns.

### Credit risk

Failure of third parties to meet their obligations.

- Default risk (and somewhat related - credit spread changes)
- Counterparty risk (including settlement risk)
- General debtors

Security is a way of reducing credit risk when lending money to a third party.

Credit ratings are an indication of credit worthiness i.e. the liklihood of default.

Includes credit events e.g. party changing credit rating.

#### Security

The extent to which credit risk arises in relation to an amount that has been lent to a third party depends on the security of the loan.

If a borrower can provide security, providing finance to that borrower will be more attractive to a lender. However, the existence of security is not an excuse for otherwise bad lending.

The decision as to what security is taken is dependent on:

- the nature of the transaction underlying
- the borrowing the covenant of the borrower
- market circumstances and the comparative negotiating strength of lender and borrower
- what security is available.

The covenant of the borrower means the overall creditworthiness of the borrower.

The most common asset to take as security is property.

This can be built into the debt issue on the basis of a fixed charge (ie secured against a specified property or properties) or a floating charge (ie secured against a pool of changing properties).

### Liquidity risk

Risk that, while the entity may be solvent, the entity may not be able to meet obligations as they fall due (or can only secure resources at excessive cost).

For a market, this is the risk that the volume of asset traded will have an adverse price effect.

Liquidity, how quickly an asset can be turned into cash at a predictable price), is not the same as marketability (how easy it is to buy and sell an asset).

### Business risk

Specific to the business undertaken.

- Underwriting risk
- Poor claims experience
- Financing a project that is unsuccessful
- Exposure to a particular risk is greater than expected
- Lower sales volume than expected
- (Competitor actions)

---

Business risk differs from operational risk in that the latter are non-financial events that have financial consequences.

We will discuss operational risk in the next section.

The business risks of **financial product providers** can be further divided into the following sub-categories;

- underwriting risk â€“ arising in relation to the underwriting approach taken
- insurance risk â€“ arising from the uncertainties relating to claim rates and amounts
- financing risk â€“ arising in relation to the financing of projects or other activities
- exposure risk â€“ arising in relation to the amount of business sold or retained, or to its concentration or lack of diversification.

Examples of business risk are;

- Underwriting - a life or general insurer not having adequate underwriting standards, and thus taking on risks at an inadequate price
- Insurance - an insurer suffering more claims than anticipated
- Financing - a provider of finance, such as a bank, investing in a business or project that fails to be successful
- Exposure - a reinsurer having greater exposure than planned to a particular risk event â€“ for example through writing whole account protection covers as well as primary reinsurance of the risk
- a music production company promoting a CD that fails to sell
- a competitor launching a new product in the week before your similar product launch
- an umbrella manufacturer whose sales suffer in a drought.

    It might be argued that a drought, as an external event, is an external risk.

    However, the profits of the company will be so closely correlated with the amount of rainfall that the risk is key to the company's business.


### Operational risk and external risk

Risk of loss due to failed internal systems, processes, people, or external
events.

- Errors in calculations and/or projections
- Wrong choice of model
- Inadequate internal processes
- Dominance of a single person
- Reliance on third parties
- Failure to plan properly (for external events)
- Risk of (further) regulation
- Competition
- Reputation
    - particularly if selling to the elderly
    - with pushy sales techniques
- Poor management of data and the underwriting process

Natural disasters are systematic (i.e. non-diversifiable) risks.

## Example qus

_Risks of new unit-linked product launch with simple fee structure_

Risk of expenses exceeding charges, and losses being made.
This risk is higher than otherwise because of the charges cap.

Risk, although expenses don't exceed charges, that the difference is less than
assumed when profitability was assessed.

Risk of mismatch between charges and expenses.
% charge may match investment costs, but general admin costs, and particularly
transaction/premium collection costs may be in money terms.

Risk of lower than average policy size/premiums so that charges are too low.

Risk of higher than expected frequency of premium payments â€“
exacerbates the above charges risks.

Risk of higher than expected inflation of expenses.

Risk of lower than expected investment performance.
Charges will be lower.
Ability to recruit and retain policyholders will be reduced.
Possible loss of preferred provider status with government.

Risk of high levels of fund switches/ redirections.
No explicit charges possible to cover these.

High business volume risks.
Strain on capital - may start to run out.
A big issue for this contract as likely to need non-unit reserves
to cover future excess of expenses over charges.
Normally reserves are contract by contract calc i.e.
some small pols definitely need reserves,
even if the overall portfolio wouldn't.
The charge cap is an increased guarantee risk,
so further increases capital required.
Similarly a guarantee on the deposit fund price not falling further
increases capital.
Administration levels may become too stretched leading to poor publicity for
company.

Low business volume risks.
Unable to recoup fixed development costs of product,
including costs of setting up new funds.
High per policy costs result,
and these may have to be disclosed.
Unable to cover running costs -
need to meet critical mass of funds under management for product to break even.

Business volume risks exacerbated because this is a new savings initiative -
no track record/historic data available to confidently estimate popularity of
idea/take up of this company's policies.
Such risks arise from model/parameter/data errors/random fluctuations.
Possible to study similar initiatives/data from overseas, but relevance
questionable.

Risk that government might withdraw/reduce incentives.
Depends on whether cross party support has been gained so as to guarantee them
long term.
Otherwise, economic/fiscal cycles vary and what was once a savings priority
for the government becomes less so in future.
Risk that government withdraws preferred provider status to this company.

Risk that govt may drive charge cap lower in future.
Or start imposing harsher conditions on providers eg regular/expensive
disclosures to policyholders,
due diligence exercises expensive to comply with.

Risk that the savings initiative fails eg public simply don't like the idea of
savings, or have something against this particular company or industry e.g.
scandals, adverse PR.

Risks from lower than expected persistency
(also mortality/morbidity contribute).
Persistency rates always difficult to estimate,
but especially here with new product/incentives.
Early withdrawals won't cover their initial set up costs,
as no up front or exit charges allowed.
There will be a very long term payback period.
This further increases capital required up front.
Incentives may drive withdrawal behaviour
e.g. spot withdrawal of funds after payment of incentive/loyalty bonus.
A range of related risks will occur
e.g. economic/unemployment/inflation risks/personal circumstances of
policyholder changes.
This will affect the need for funds to be withdrawn.
But also will affect level of disposable income â€“
risks also of premium reductions; lower than expected prem increases.
At later durations, the idea is that funds will have built up and profits arise
from each year the policy continues.
So lower than expected late duration persistency will also be a risk.

Liquidity risks
e.g. unexpected economic downturn - harder to get good value for assets,
people want their money more, unlikely to be able to delay paying out to savers.

Different risks could all be happening together
e.g. weak economy means poor investment returns and lower job
prospects/disposable incomes.

Risks from competitors.
Competitor products may be more appealing to customers,
or directly try to undercut the charges being levied by this company.
Extent of risk again depends on preferred provider status and ability to
market a simplified unit-linked product.

Risks from marketability.
The low cost nature of the product means that direct sales is likely,
at least for simplified product.
This sales channel largely relies on the saver buying,
rather than being sold, a policy and therefore low sales volumes are a
particular risk.
The more complex/flexible product may involve other distribution channels,
e.g. brokers or salesforce, introducing misselling risk.

Risks from new systems/infrastructure.
Likely to need at least some new premium collection systems
e.g. to deal with high frequency/small premium transactions.
Risk of teething problems, or failures with the new systems.
A complete overhaul of these systems to new digital technology may be very
costly and risky.
Specific risks around data security, systems/network outages.
Related risk that such issues could lead to bad publicity or regulatory fines.

Similarly, may be involved with new payment partners,
e.g. online/supermarket/smartphone interfaces.
These may have high charges or bring operational risks.

Risk of loss of value from lapse of existing products
(and possible re-entry in to new product with this or other companies).
Where this new product can perform the same role as existing products of the
company, it is at risk of lapses on the existing products where their charges
are higher than this new product.
The extent of the risk depends on whether there are any exit penalties on the
existing products, and how they compare with the loss of future profits on exit.
Associated risk from complexity/time/expense of having to manage such
policyholder activity, which may be large in volume.

This is a new product so there is a risk of lack of data leading to incorrect
assumptions.

There is a misselling risk if the more complex aspects of the product are
oversimplified.

General operational risks e.g. fraud, poor customer service, increased regs to
deal with.

Risk of adverse changes to tax rates/rules or status.
