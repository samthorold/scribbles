## Approaches to valuing assets and liabilities

Discounted cash flow: long-term discount rate used to value both assets and
liabs.

Market-related approaches: replicating portfolio or actual asset-based approach
can be used to value the liabs.
Assets are valued at market value.
Aim to determine market price of liabs and hence discount rate.

## Fair value

Amount for which an asset could be exchanged or liability settled between
knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction.

**Or**

The amount that the enterprise would have to pay a third party to take over the
liab.

These methods aim to find the market value of liabs, but in practice there is
no secondary market for most liabs.
Therefore the market value cannot be found directly.
Instead we need to try and find market-based assumptions.

## Setting the discount rate

| Method | Valuation of assets | Valuation of liabs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Traditional discounted casflow | Discounted cash flows using long-term rate based on actual holding or notional portfolio | Discount rate is the same
long-term rate as used for assets |
| Replicating portfolio (mark to market) | Market value | Discount rate implied by market price of investments that match liabs - often bonds |
| Replicating portfolio (bond yields plus risk premium) | Market value | Discount rate as in mark to market method, but then adjusted to take account of higher expected returns on other asset classes |
| Asset-based discount rate | Market value | Discount rate is expected return on assets, weighted by proportions held of each asset class | Fair or market value of liabs can be estimated by discounting using risk-fre rates.

## Valuing options

Not always appropriate to assume that the highest cost option is always
exercised.
For example, the attraction of cash or tax-free benefit might mean that
individuals do not exercise an option that is in the money from the
provider's perspective.

The risk of anti-selection must be allowed for when valuing options.

Options in liabs can be valued by finding a market option that replicates it.
A closed form approximation may be used e.g. Black-Scholes.

Contract values are highly sensitive to option pricing methods and
assumptions.
The assumptions used will depend on, among other things

- State of the economy (scenario specific)
- Demographic factors such as age, health, and employment status
- Cultural bias
- Consumer sophistication

## Valuing guarantees

Guarantees are usually best valued by a stochastic approach.
A stochastic model allows for the likelihood of the guarantee biting and its
expected cost.

Guarantees may become more or less onerous on the provider over time depending
on how experience develops.

The value of guarantees and their influences on consumer behaviour will vary
widely according to the economic scenarios and the sophistication of the
market.

## Sensitivity analysis

Can be used

- To help determine the extent of the margins needed in assumptions, to allow
for adverse future experience
- In determining the extent of any global provisions req'd

Sensitivity analysis can be done on a single or multiple assumptions.

## Different methods of allowing for risk in cash flows

[2019 April Paper 1 Q6-iii](40-2019-04-01.md#6-iii)

- Build in a margin to each assumption
- Apply an overall contingency loading by increasing the liability value by a
certain percentage
- Adjust the discount rate to reflect the risk in the project or liability

Allowance for financial risk in market-consistent or fair valuation is implicit
if a replicating portfolio or stochastic model (calibrated to the market) is
used.
Adjustment for mismatching risk is generally not made so as to achieve
independence of the fair value liability valuation from the actual assets held.

Allowance for non-financial risk is achieved by adjusting the cash flows or the
discount rate, or alternatively through an extra provision or capital req'mt
such as the Solvency II risk margin.

### Best estimate and margin

An approach to the uncertainty surrounding benefit costs and asset returns may be taken by using assumptions that do not reflect an actuary’s "best estimate" of future experience.

A risk margin is built in to each assumption by using "best estimate" assumptions together with an explicit margin for caution.

- higher than best estimate mortality rates when valuing term assurance liabilities.
- lower than best estimate mortality rates when valuing annuity liabilities.

Assessment of the necessary margins depends on the risk involved, and its materiality to the final result.

Where a risk factor has been stable over many years and is not exposed to economic events, it may be reasonable to add a simple percentage loading.

- mortality risk for lives aged between 30 and 55 in developed countries.

In other cases a more detailed analysis of experience for various sources, perhaps using a stochastic approach, may be needed to determine a margin consistent with the risk appetite.

Care should be taken in considering the overall effect when introducing margins, since the introduction of small margins in many assumptions might lead to a cumulative effect of the basis being stronger than desired.

### Contingency loading

This approach is to increase the liability value by a certain percentage.

The choice of this "contingency loading" is effectively another assumption ...

... and should ideally reflect the degree of uncertainty that exists ...

... expected to increase with the value of the liabilities but not in a proportionate manner.

Given the analysis tools now available, this approach is excessively arbitrary.

### Discounting cashflows at a risk premium

This is the traditional discounted cashflow approach ...

... where the cashflows are assessed on a best estimate basis ...

... and then discounted at a rate of return that reflects the overall risk of the project or liability.

Determination of the risk premium is often arbitrary ...

... and in some circumstances it is a requirement set out by the firm’s governing body.

Frequently, the risk discount rate is not based on the risks associated with the cashflow ...

... but is the opportunity cost of the firm not pursuing some other business opportunity.

If risk discount rates are high, they can affect the near and the remote cashflows disproportionately to the actual risk of the cashflows.

## Different methods of calculating provisions

- Statistical analysis: many claims following known pattern
- Case by case estimate: assessment of claim records where the are few claims
- Proportionate approach: base on amount of net premium yet to expire

An equalisation reserve may be set up to smooth results from year to year where
there are low prob risks with a high and volatile financial outcome.

---

If a portfolio is such that there is no method of assessing a required provision with any degree of confidence ...

... this suggests that the risks ought to be transferred elsewhere.

### Statistical analysis

If the population exposed to a risk is large enough ...

... and the consequence of a risk event is approximately normally distributed ...

... then a mathematical approach to establishing a provision for the risk will give a valid answer.

A company establishing a provision for notified theft claims under a household contents policy might simply provide for the number of notified claims multiplied by the average cost of a claim in the last year ...

... This would give a best estimate provision.

To establish a prudent provision that would be sufficient at a ruin probability of any given percentage ...

... a simple analysis of the normal distribution will generate the required result.

### Case-by-case estimates

If the insured risks are rare events and also have a large variability in outcome ...

... then statistical analysis may break down.

- establishing a provision for notified motor accident personal injury liability claims ...

	... there is little alternative but to carry out a case by case examination of the claim files to assess the extent of injury, the prognosis, and hence the likely claim amount ...

	... Even this approach still leaves risk of injury award inflation that a court might grant.

The case by case examination involves the claims assessor examining each individual claim file for the reported claims ...

... and assessing the likely cost of settling each claim.

### Proportionate approach

Making provisions for risks which a provider has accepted but where the risk event has not yet occurred ...

... set a provision on the basis that the premium charged is a fair assessment of the cost of the risk, expenses, and profit.

If a premium basis allows for 25% of the premium to cover expenses, commissions and profit ...

... then one approach to establishing a provision for the unexpired part of a year’s cover is to assume that 75% of the premium covers risks equally through the period of the policy.

A provision for the unexpired duration can be set by a simple proportion of this 75%.

### Equalisation reserves

[2019 April Paper 1 Q6-iv](40-2019-04-01.md#6-iv)

An example of the issues discussed above occurs where a product provider might wish to exhibit stable results from year to year ...

... but where the portfolio contains low probability risks with a large and highly volatile financial outcome.

In years where such an event occurs the company may show a significant reduction in profits ...

... where no event occurs, profits will be greater than the long-term average.

To smooth results, a company may establish a claims equalisation reserve in years when no claim arises ...

... with a view to using the reserve to smooth results when a claim does occur.

These reserves do not fit with the definition of a provision ...

... but nevertheless are used in some jurisdictions for general insurance.

Note that not all regulatory regimes recognise equalisation reserves ...

... for example, these reserves do not exist under Solvency II.

Tax authorities are often not prepared to take such reserves into account in computing profits.

Equalisation reserves are seen as a way of deferring profits and hence tax.
