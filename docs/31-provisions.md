Amounts set aside to meet future liabilities.

The value placed on provisions is highly dependent on the assumptions used
which will be highly dependent on the reasons for calculating the provisions.

*Exam style [3]*

Provisions are the amount that the provider determines are needed to meet future liabilities. *[1]*

*[1/2]*

- the liabilities to be shown in the provider's published accounts and reports
- the liabilities for regulatory purposes
- the liabilities to be shown in the provider’s internal management accounts and reports
- the value of the provider for merger or acquisition
- the excess of assets over liabilities and whether any discretionary benefits can be awarded
- investment strategy.

## Calculating individual provisions

Reasons for calculating individual provisions

- Determine value of liabs for published accounts
- Demonstrate supervisory solvency
- Determine value of liabs for internal management accounts
- Value the provider for merger or acquisition (or transfer liabs)
- Determine whether discretionary benefits can be awarded
- Setting future contribution levels for a benefit scheme
- Valuing benefit improvements for a pension scheme
- Calculating discontinuance benefits
- Influencing investment strategy
- Provide disclosure information to beneficiaries

## Calculating global provisions

Needed for

- Additional protection against insolvency
- Cover risks, financial and non-financial, that cannot necessarily be
attributed to individual contracts
- Reflect the degree of mismatching of assets and liabilities

Provider's risk management startegy is an important influence on provision
for risks.

## Different bases

The bases in order of increasing strength are

- Optimistic
- Best estimate
- Cautious

A best estimate basis is a basis with an equal probability of overstating or understating values.

Key assumptions required to value a medical benefits scheme;

- discount rate (used to discount the liabilities to their present day value)
- inflation of medical benefits (which may be higher than price inflation)
- incidence of sickness

    and likely duration of illness

    split by age, gender and different types of illness

- mortality rates
- discontinuance rates (ie likelihood of members leaving the scheme)
- future entry rates to the scheme

    and likely entry age / gender of employees (if the contribution rate for the future is being set too).

Information that could be used to set the assumptions;

- past experience of the scheme
- past experience of similar schemes

    perhaps from industry-wide statistics population statistics

    for example from the national healthcare system

- discussions with the company as to its future intentions

    for example whether it has an intention to perform a redundancy exercise

- projections of investment returns

    for example based on the views of investment analysts or derived from market yields

- projections of indices relating to the inflation of medical benefits.

## Choice of basis and valuation method


### Purpose and client

The following factors will usually dictate the strength of the basis on which values should be produced:

- the reason a value needs to be determined

    For example, a valuation for accounting purposes might be on a best estimate basis

    but a valuation to demonstrate financial strength and security might be on a more prudent basis.

- the needs of the client

    For example, the client may be the beneficiaries, trustees, regulator, shareholders etc.

- the requirements of any legislative or regulatory authority.

In some cases, the valuation method may also be prescribed.

In many cases presentation of a range of values, or values for alternative scenarios, may be more useful to the client in making any necessary decisions.

For example, before making a long-term financial commitment ...

... a retirement benefit scheme's sponsor may wish to know the actuary's "best estimate" of the costs ...

... and also the costs assuming a worse scenario for future experience.

### Nature of the assets

There are occasions when, to determine the value of the liabilities, it will be appropriate to take account of the nature of the assets. Examples are:

- when the liabilities are specifically linked to the underlying assets

    such as a unit trust or internal investment fund

- when the covenant of the sponsor has no value

    eg when a pension fund is set up by a sponsor, but the sponsor makes no commitment to provide funds to make up any shortfall should the assets held turn out to be insufficient to meet the benefits promised.

    In this situation the benefits paid may need to be reduced to reflect the actual assets available.

- for the market-consistent valuation of liabilities in relation to financial guarantees on life insurance contracts

    since the value will depend on the volatility of returns on the assets held.

The influence of assets on the liability valuation method is considered further in the next chapter.

## Setting assumptions with regard to purpose

Published accounts: legislation and accounting principles

- Going-concern or break-up
- Reflecting a true and fair value
- Best estimate vs prudent

Supervisory solvency: consider the degree of prudence and any prescribed methods / assumptions vs actuarial judgement with disclosure requirement

Internal accounts: best estimate

Liability transfers: BE basis used to value liabs to be fair to all parties and achieve agreement from actuaries acting for either party.

- Different basis might be used because
    - Power imbalance between the parties
    - Stronger desire to proceed by one of the parties
    - Recognise the need to hold margins to protect security

Determine whether discretionary benefits can be awarded: Likely cautious so surplus is not over-stated

Setting contribution levels: assumptions used will depend on the objectives of the parties concerned and on the structure of the membership.

Calculating discontinuance benefits: BE probably

Setting investment strategy: realistic set of assumptions based on sensitivity and scenario testing.

- A stochastic approach can add significant value.
- since it can more closely replicate the pattern of investment returns in the real world.
- In addition, the output of running the model indicates the range of likely outcomes with associated probabilities, therefore providing additional information.


Disclosure information for beneficiaries: assumptions will reflect legislation but a realistic basis will typically be used with a range of results also provided.

## Setting assumptions with regards to the client

Different clients may have different purposes or reasons for a liability valuation, so the considerations in the previous section are relevant.

However, even if the basic purpose of the valuation is the same, different stakeholders may require a different level of strength of basis.

Risk management strategy and risk appetite is a key influence on this.

A provider's risk appetite will also influence the level of provisioning for risks.

In managing the liabilities, there may be a desire to reduce the risk of the provisions set aside being insufficient to meet the benefits promised.

A person or company responsible for the management of the provision may therefore wish to consider values that are cautious.

The 50% probability of under-provision created by using "best estimate" assumptions may be too great.

The main clients to consider in the case of a benefit scheme are trustees and beneficiaries (including employee beneficiaries), and the sponsor.

The 50% probability of under-provision created by using "best estimate" assumptions may be considered too great by trustees responsible for the funding decisions under a benefit scheme ...

... particularly if the benefits being valued are discontinuance rights.

However, trustees and beneficiaries must also note the views of the sponsor.

It would not be in the interests of the beneficiaries if a cautious approach to funding led to a sponsor reducing benefits due to excessive projected cost.

A cautious approach will lead to higher recommended contributions.

If the sponsor feels that this level of contributions is unaffordable ...

... they may reduce the benefits in order to cut cost.

In the extreme case they may decide to close the scheme.

In the case of an employer sponsor, a cautious approach could also lead to other cuts in the business ...

... or perhaps insolvency.

These may also not be in the interests of employee beneficiaries.

The basis preferred by the sponsor will depend on a variety of factors, including security, opportunity cost, use of capital in the business, tax etc.

For example, an optimistic approach may be appropriate if the sponsor has alternative uses for capital currently ...

... and so would prefer low contributions now.

In future, however, a more cautious basis might be used to compensate.

## Setting assumptions with regards to prudence

- purpose of the valuation
- objectives of the client
- regulation
- chars of the scheme
    - size
    - maturity
    - funding level
- degree of certainty in the assumptions
- financial significance of the assumptions
- tax

Ultimately, the level of prudence does not determine the actual cost of the pension scheme.
This is only known when all liabilities have been extinguished.

However, for a funding valuation, the assumptions determine the contribution rate
and so the pace at which funds are built up.
