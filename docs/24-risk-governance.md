Risk control is about either reducing the likelihood of the risk event occurring or reducing the severity or consequences of a risk event that does occur.

Risk management can be described as the process of ensuring that the risks to which an organisation is exposed are the risks to which it thinks it is exposed and to which it is prepared to be exposed.

The key aim of risk management is to protect an organisation against adverse experience that could result in it being unable to meet its liabilities.


## Risk management process

!!! note "Risk management"

    The process of ensuring the risks to which an organisation is exposed are the risks to which it thinks it is exposed and to which it is prepared to be exposed.

The process consists of

- Identification (of risks and possible controls)
- Classification (including allocation of ownership)
- Control (mitigation of probability, severity, and consequences)
- Financing (determine cost of each risk, including cost effectiveness of risk
controls, and the availability of capital to cover retained risk)
- Monitoring (regular review and re-assessment of risks together with overall
business review to identify new or previously omitted risks)

Risk appetite is an important input here.

### Risk identification

Risk identification is the recognition of the risks that can threaten the income and assets of an organisation.

This is the hardest aspect of risk management.

Risk identification is the hardest aspect of risk management because the risks to which an organisation is exposed are numerous and because risk identification needs to be comprehensive.

It is not surprising that the biggest risks to an organisation are those that are not identified, particularly when they relate to events that have not occurred before.

Having identified each risk, it is necessary to determine whether it is systematic or diversifiable.

For each risk it is necessary to have a preliminary identification of possible risk control processes that could be put in place ...

... which will **reduce either the likelihood of the risk event occurring or the impact of the risk event should it occur**.

It is also important to identify opportunities to exploit risks and gain a competitive advantage over other providers.

Taking on risk is a potential source of profit and is the raison d'être for insurance and reinsurance companies.

Another part of the risk identification process is to determine to what extent the organisation is prepared to be exposed to each risk.

This is called the risk appetite or risk tolerance level.

### Risk classification

Having identified the risks, the company would then classify them – i.e. group them into categories.

Classifying risks into groups aids the calculation of the cost of risk and the value of diversification.

It also enables a risk "owner" to be allocated from the management team.

The risk owner would normally be responsible for the control processes for the risk.

### Risk measurement

Risk measurement is the estimation of the probability of a risk event occurring and its likely severity.

This would normally be carried out before and after application of any risk controls ...

... and the cost of the risk controls would be included in the assessment.

Risk measurement gives the basis for evaluating and selecting methods of risk control and whether the risk should be;

- declined
- transferred
- mitigated
- retained with or without controls.

### Risk controls

Risk control is about determining and implementing methods of risk mitigation.

Risk control involves deciding whether to reject, fully accept or partially accept each identified risk.

This stage also involves identifying different possible mitigation options for each risk that requires mitigation.

Risk control measures are systems that aim to mitigate the risks or the consequences of risk events by:

- reducing the probability of a risk occurring
    - introducing good safety procedures within a company to reduce the risk of a fire starting
- limiting the severity of the effects of a risk that does occur
    - having sprinkler systems and adequate fire extinguishers, so that a fire that does occur can quickly be put out
- reducing the consequences of a risk that does occur
    - having adequate insurance in place to meet the costs of a fire that does occur
    - having a business continuity plan in place, which could be put into action in order to reduce the adverse operational consequences of the risk event.

A risk that gives rise to serious exposures to the organisation must be a priority candidate for the application of control techniques.

Not all risks occur at a single point event.

For example, in a stock market "crash", prices do not normally fall in a single day, but the full effect of the crash is observed over a number of weeks or months.

Frequently risk mitigation techniques involve management actions to be taken when certain trigger points are reached (for example to protect a portfolio value, or to reduce the amount of risk being accepted).

It is vital that the actions really are taken when the trigger is reached and not delayed "because it might get better tomorrow", however unpalatable the actions might be.

This reinforces the importance of senior management buy-in to the risk management process.

The models and assumptions used in the process are only valid to the extent that the actions would actually be taken in practice.

Discussion and modelling of possible courses of action and their consequences, including modelling the effects of no action or delayed action, is a useful tool in increasing management understanding of the business.

Where more than one option exists for mitigating a particular risk, it will be necessary to compare each option, identify which option is optimal and then implement the appropriate options.

#### Determination of risk appetite

The organisation's risk appetite is another key feature in the decision on the approach to take to control individual risks.

Risk appetite is likely to have both quantitative and qualitative components.

The qualitative aspect of risk appetite includes risk preferences of the organisation.

Risk appetite is discussed further in [Chapter 27](27-accepting-risk.md).

### Risk financing

Risk financing involves:

- determining the likely cost of each risk (including the cost of any mitigations and the expected losses and cost of capital arising from retained risk)
- ensuring the organisation has sufficient financial resources available to continue its objectives after a loss event occurs.

### Risk monitoring

Having decided that all or part of a risk should be retained, with or without controls, the risks should be monitored.

Risk monitoring is the regular review and re-assessment of all the risks previously identified, coupled with an overall business review to identify new or previously omitted risks.

It is important to establish a clear management responsibility for each risk in order that monitoring and control procedures can be effective.

Risk monitoring is the process of ensuring that risks **continue** to be managed.

The objectives of risk monitoring might be to:

- determine if the exposure to risk and/or the risk appetite of the organisation has changed over time
- identify new risks or changes in the nature of existing risks
- report on risks that have actually occurred and how they were managed
- assess whether the existing risk management process is effective.

Carrying out risk monitoring does not complete the risk management process.

The risk management process, like the actuarial control cycle, is iterative.

From the objectives of risk monitoring listed above, we can see that the risk monitoring stage leads logically back into the risk management process through the re-identification of risks.

### Examples of risk management from qus

The project should be well planned and costed in advance.
Action should be taken at the first sign of overrun and increase in costs.
A fixed fee could be arranged for some of the work.

Investigate to see if planning permission has been given for similar projects
locally (may not be likely) or in other areas.
Could adjust plans if necessary or lobby those with influence.

Investigate background of all contractors,
use tight contract wording and/or penalties.
Could investigate the condition of the proposed sites,
take out insurance for weather, natural disaster risks.

Local knowledge and expertise may be needed and
additional research will need to be conducted.

Additional research relating to the risks in a different country.
Could use derivatives to protect against currency risks.

Research position of other universities and
what the students they are aiming to attract are looking for in a university.
Ensure that high quality infrastructure is matched by high quality staff.
Additional marketing may be needed.

Will need to keep monitoring their position.

## Benefits of a risk management process

Provides ability to

- Avoid surprises
- Improve stability and quality of the business
- Improve growth and returns by exploiting risk opportunities
- Improve growth and returns through better management and allocation of capital
- Identify opportunities arising from natural synergies
- Identify opportunities arising from risk "arbitrage"
    - The provider may have a different view on the "price" of the risk relative to another party.
    - The provider may therefore be prepared to accept a risk for a higher premium than its own view of the cost of the risk, or conversely transfer a risk to another party for a lower premium than its own view of the cost.
- Give stakeholders confidence that the business is well managed

And should

- Incorporate all risks (financial and non-financial)
- Evaluate all relevant strategies for managing risk
- Consider all relevant constraints
- Exploit hedges and portfolio effects
- Exploit financial and operational efficiencies

## Risk vs uncertainty

Risk contains an element of uncertainty but may have some uncertain elements.

A risk can be associated with an event that is certain in time – will it rain on my wedding day?

Alternatively, the event can be certain and the issue is when it will occur – how long will I live to draw my pension?

Thirdly, both the occurrence and the timing can be uncertain – will my house suffer from storm damage?

A risk event having occurred, there can then be uncertainty about the consequences of the event – is the loss amount fixed or variable, and what is the shape of the loss distribution?

Finally, even certain strategies to avoid loss may not be risk-free on detailed investigation.

For example, purchasing insurance avoids loss in respect of the covered event, but still involves risks relating to counterparty default, liquidity (payment of the insurance premium) and whether there is sufficient market capacity when needed.

## Systematic vs diversifiable risk

Whether a risk is systematic or diversifiable depends on the context.

For example, an investment fund that is constrained to invest in domestic equities, because of the prospectus and other information issued to clients, will see the domestic equity market as a systematic risk.

A worldwide equity fund that can invest in domestic and overseas equities will see exposure to the domestic equity market as a diversifiable risk.

Such a fund can hold investments from a wide range of international markets and thus limit the exposure to any particular national market.

### Systematic risk

Systematic risk is risk that affects an entire financial market or system, and not just specific participants.

It is not possible to avoid systematic risk through diversification.

In the context of investment markets, the risk of a decline in the market as a whole, with all stocks being affected, is a systematic risk.

Assuming that the investor is required to participate in the market, the risk cannot be avoided.

Conversely, the risk of a decline in the value of a single security can be mitigated by an investor spreading the risk and investing in a large number of small holdings.

A portfolio of 30 to 40 securities in developed markets such as the UK or US (more in case of developing markets because of higher asset volatilities) will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified to limit exposure to that of systematic risk only.

So risks relating to individual securities, as opposed to risks relating to the whole market, can be diversified away.

---

The term systematic risk is sometimes used interchangeably with systemic risk.

Systemic risk is a specific technical term used in finance.

Systematic risk has an additional more general meaning that is "of or pertaining to a system".

### Diversifiable risk

Diversifiable risk arises from an individual component of a financial market or system.

In the context of investment markets, diversifiable risk occurs when the value of an individual security falls.

A rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of most financial systems.

In other words each security is individually priced by the market given the market's perception of risk and reward.

The market makes no allowance in the pricing for the investor choosing a concentrated portfolio.

As a result, investors should diversify across asset classes and within asset classes.

The use of diversification as a risk control technique is covered in more detail in a later chapter.

Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context - i.e. its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness - as opposed to its "stand-alone riskiness".

According to the above theory, all rational investors would hold a portfolio of assets that was as well diversified as possible.

If all investors had the same estimates of the relative risks and returns then they would all hold the same market portfolio.

It would be impossible to outperform the market except by chance, so only index-tracking funds would exist.

However, in practice different investors have different estimates of the risks and returns.

As a result, they will hold a less well-diversified portfolio if they believe that it offers a sufficiently higher expected return than the market to compensate them for the diversifiable risks they take.

The risk appetite of the investor will affect the extent that they are prepared to move away from the market portfolio in search of higher returns.

## Enterprise risk management

### Business units

A business unit might

- Carry out the same activity in different locations
- Carry out different activities in the same location
- Carry out different activities in different locations
- Operate in different countries
- Operate in different markets
- Be separate companies in a group, which each have their own business units

### Managing risk at the business unit level

A decision must be made as to whether risk should be managed at;

- the business unit level
- the group (or enterprise) level.

The latter approach is called enterprise risk management.

One approach to risk management would be for the parent company to determine its overall risk appetite and to divide this up among the business units.

Just as each business unit has its own management team to run its business, the business unit management team manages the risks of the business within the risk appetite they have been allocated.

As risk analysis involves allocation of capital to support the risks retained by each business unit, this approach is likely to mean that the group is not making best use of its available capital.

It is clear that this approach makes no allowance for the benefits of diversification or pooling of risks.

A crude approach to allow for diversification would be simply to allow the risk appetites allocated to the business units to add up to perhaps 130% or 150% of the group's overall risk appetite.

!!! note "Why the total risk appetites of the business units should add up to more than 100% of the group’s overall risk appetite."

    Risk appetite refers to the amount of risk that the business can tolerate, i.e. the maximum exposure.

    The maximum exposure to risk for a particular business unit can be higher than its proportionate share of the maximum exposure to risk for the total group, due to diversification.

    When the risks of the business units are aggregated together, diversification means that the overall group risk exposure will be lower than the sum of the risk exposures across each business unit.

    This is because it is very unlikely that the risks will be perfectly correlated with each other.

    There is likely to be some independence of risks (imperfect correlation), meaning that it is extremely unlikely that the risk events across all business units will happen at the same time.

### Managing risk at the enterprise level


A preferable approach is to establish the group risk management function as a major activity at the enterprise level.

The group can then impose similar risk assessment procedures on the various business units, which will enable the results from the various models to be combined into a risk assessment model at the entity level.

By examining risk at group level allowance can be made for pooling of risk, diversification achievable and economies of scale.

This should prove to be the most capital efficient way of managing risk.

Enterprise risk management involves considering the risks of the enterprise as a whole, rather than considering individual risks in isolation.

This allows the concentration of risk arising from a variety of sources within an enterprise to be appreciated, and for the diversifying effects of risks to be allowed for.

This will also give the group management insight into the areas with resulting undiversified risk exposures where the risks need to be transferred or capital set against them.

This will be an important feed into the business planning and capital allocation cycles.

Such an approach to risk management will enable the company to take advantage of opportunities to enhance value, i.e. if they understand their risks better, they can use them to their advantage by taking greater (educated) risks in order to increase returns.

Enterprise risk management is not just about reducing risk – it is also about a company putting itself into a better position to be able to take advantage of strategic risk-based opportunities.

!!! note "Key features of enterprise risk management"

    - Consistency across business units
    - Holistic - consider risks of enterprise as a whole, rather than in isolation, allowing appropriately for diversification
    - Seek opportunities to enhance value

## Stakeholders in risk governance

- directors / senior management
- risk managers and any Chief Risk Officer
- all other employees
- customers
- shareholders
- credit rating agencies
- regulators.

Employees / board / managers

- seek to identify risks
- seek to identify ways to control risks
- adhere to agreed risk management framework
- report risks identified to management

CRO / risk managers

- risk budget will be allocated between different business units
- allowing for the benefits of any diversification of risk across the business
- responsible for overseeing the data collected on risk and for risk monitoring, reporting, and management
- will define and communicate the risk governance framework
- e.g. by setting out the key objectives in relation to risk management
- will look for offsetting risks across the business to reduce exposure to [mortality and longevity risk]

Shareholders

- raise concerns about risk governance at shareholder meetings
- and use their voting rights to instigate change.
- will monitor firm's approach to risk and its governance

Regulator / state

- can require the insurer to hold sufficient capital
- according to the insurer's risk profile
- might provide risk checklist for insurers to use.

Actuaries and other professionals

- Identify, report on, and manage risks
- depending on the role of the adviser
- e.g. an actuary can assess the impact of different risks on the [insurer's] capital position

### Internal

Whilst the board and senior management will drive governance aspects such as setting the risk appetite, all employees have a responsibility in relation to risk.

In an efficiently run organisation, all members of staff are stakeholders in risk governance.

In a company with a well-embedded risk culture, all employees should be looking out for risks to which the business is exposed and should be suggesting ways in which risks can be mitigated or controlled.

Reports from staff on risk should be noted and rewarded through the normal appraisal system.

All large companies and all providers of financial products should have a designated Chief Risk Officer.

This role will normally be at the enterprise level.

It will be responsible for allocating the risk budget to business units after allowing for diversification, and for monitoring the group exposure to risks and documenting the risks that have materialised and affected the group.

Business units will often have a risk manager, although this function may be combined with another role, depending on size.

At business unit level the responsibility is to make full use of the allocated risk budget, as well as data collection, monitoring and reporting.

### External

Organisations can also encourage their customers to note and report risks that they come across in using the company’s products or visiting the company’s premises.

Other stakeholders may have a strong interest in risk governance within an organisation.

This could include any shareholders of the organisation, any regulators of the organisation and credit rating agencies.

Shareholders can drive risk governance, e.g. by influencing the development of the risk appetite statement.

Credit rating agencies and regulators will be interested in the quality of risk governance, and may impose minimum standards.
