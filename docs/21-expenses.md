For most financial services providers, the expenses, in roughly descending order of amount, might be:

- staff salaries, pensions contributions, national insurance contributions, etc
- commission payments
- office rent and related expenses
- office equipment (eg computers)
- investment costs
- office consumables (eg stationery).

---

Expenses can be split between
fixed and variable, and
direct and indirect.

Fixed expenses are constant in the short term.
Variable expenses vary by the amount of business handled.
Some expenses fall between these two,
such as management costs,
and remain constant apart from large changes from time to time.

Direct expenses can be identified as belonging to a particular class or
classes of business while indirect expenses cannot.

## Expense analysis

[2019 April Paper 1 Q5](40-2019-04-01.md#5-ii)

## Insurance company expenses

Examples of variable expenses that might be related to one or more different measures of the amount of business are:

- commission – related to the amount of premium income
- postal costs for sending contract documents and claim forms – related to the number of contracts sold and the number of claims
- legal expenses – related to the claim amount.

There is a third category of expenses that is essentially fixed, but that can vary in large amounts from time to time.

Within this category would be a senior management team that would normally be a relatively fixed expense, but would be changed if the structure or business of the company changed significantly.

Similarly, a declining operation might be able to sub-let a whole floor of its office premises, when it becomes small enough.

Staff-related expenses might remain fixed in real terms in the short term. In the longer term, staff costs (and accommodation costs) will vary to meet:

- changing levels of new and existing business
- changes in services provided, and
- the degree of automation used to provide those services.

Isolating variable expenses is particularly important in assessing the contributions needed to provide benefits on future financial events.

Once the variable expenses have been isolated, we are left with the fixed expenses.

The spreading of fixed expenses between contracts will depend crucially on the estimates of the amount of new business to be written or handled.

Indirect fixed expenses are sometimes referred to as the overheads of the business.

## Benefit scheme expenses

The expenses incurred by a benefit scheme may differ from those described above, as the scheme may have none of the fixed overheads such as building maintenance or rent.

It is possible that much of the work of the scheme, such as administration, legal advice, actuarial advice or investment management is delegated to third parties who charge a fee for the service.

Where such services are provided in-house, this may be done by the sponsor’s employees and so the costs will form part of the sponsor’s total overheads.


## Expense allocation

**Expense allocation is expense analysis.**

Expenses need to be allocated between:

- classes of business, and
- functions.

By "function" we mean "activity" or "operation".

For example, the expense might relate to the activity of underwriting or the operation of administering the contract.

**One of the main reasons that expenses need to be allocated in this way is so that they can be loaded into premiums.**

This will mean that each policy contributes an appropriate amount to the total level of expenses.

Reasons for carrying out expense analyses include:

- **determining expense loadings for premiums**
- determining the expense loading for calculating provisions
- understanding the profitability of a particular product
- analysing sources of surplus (deviations of actual from expected expenses)
- analysing areas of inefficiency within the organisation
- financial planning (expense budgeting)
- cashflow management (to ensure that liquid funds are available to pay the expenses).

Expense allocations take place for

- Pricing
- Provisioning
- Profitability investigations (e.g. analysis of surplus)
- Financial planning

Premiums and provisions should be adequate to cover

- Administration costs
- Claims handling costs
- Fixed expenses
- Expected claims or benefits

Expense loading could be expressed as

- Percentage of premium (commission) or sum-assured (underwriting)
- Percentage of funds under management (investment expenses)
- Fixed amount per contract (administration cost)
- Fixed amount per claim (termination expense) or percentage of claim
(claim expense)
- Combination of the above

## Adjustments to pricing expense loadings

- Cross-subsidies
- Inflation
- Competition

Expenses need to be allocated by class and function.

## Allocation to class

### Allocating direct expenses

Direct expenses may arise from a department dealing purely with one class of business, in which case the expenses relating to that department can immediately be allocated to the relevant class.

If direct expenses arise from areas dealing with more than one class of business then **timesheets** can be kept (either for a period or permanently) to help split costs between classes.

For example, staff in an underwriting department may deal with several classes of business (eg term assurance, whole life assurance and endowment assurances).

Their costs can be allocated to each of these classes based on the time that was recorded as being spent underwriting each of them.

Staff timesheets can be used to collect this information.

### Allocating indirect expenses

The indirect expenses are harder to allocate.

By definition, the departments concerned are not related directly to any particular class of business, but form a support function for the provider.

In this case, it is necessary to find a sensible apportionment of the expenses across direct business activities.

We must allocate indirect expenses to the different classes of business.

There is no single correct approach for this, but it may help to allocate the expenses to different departments (ie business activities) first, as an intermediate step.

- Floor space (in proportion to the allocation of the salaries of the employees of that department)
- Charge out (e.g. computing expense)
- In proportion with other expenses

## Allocation to function

As well as apportioning expenses to a line of business, costs need to be apportioned by function, so that they can be allowed for in determining product pricing or the provisions for future liabilities.

Function relates to the timing of expenses.

For most types of business the high level division is into the costs of:

- securing new business
- maintaining existing business (policy renewal administration and investment expenses)
- terminating business (including claims).

Depending on the purpose of the expense analysis, these items may be sub-divided. For example, new business costs might be split into:

- marketing
- sales and commissions
- processing and policy issue, and underwriting.

The functional analysis of expenses is important in determining which expenses are charged to which contracts.

For example, in a life insurance company the costs of regular premium collection would not be charged to single premium or paid-up policies.

---

Non-commission expenses can be split into

- Initial expenses
- Maintenance expenses
    - Renewal
    - Investment
- Termination

Function allocation helps to determine which expenses are charged to
which contracts e.g.
regular vs single premium or paid-up policies.

## Determining appropriate expense loadings

An important element of a product pricing process or a process that establishes provisions for future liabilities is the determination of loadings for expenses.

These are required to ensure that sufficient premiums are charged or adequate provisions established to cover not only the expected claim costs, but also the costs of expenses related to administration and claims handling for the business written, including a contribution to the general fixed costs of the provider.

The expense loading could be expressed as a:

- percentage of premium or sum assured
- percentage of funds under management
- fixed amount per contract
- fixed amount per claim or percentage of claim amount
- combination of the above.

### Percentage of premium or sum assured

In most cases commissions paid to third parties and to employed sales staff for securing business will be proportional to the size of the contract and will usually be expressed as a percentage of premium.

These costs can be allowed for by incorporating the commission rates directly into a formula calculation or a cashflow model.

Underwriting is an example of an expense that might vary according to sum assured, since policies with high sums assured are likely to need more detailed and expensive underwriting than those for smaller amounts.

### Percentage of funds under management

Similarly, investment expenses would normally be expressed as a percentage of funds under management and these can be allowed for directly by a deduction from the investment return assumed.

### Fixed amount per contract

In most cases, office administration expenses relate to activities that are independent of the size of the contract. For example, the cost of collecting a contribution is largely the same no matter the size of the contribution.

These expenses would normally be expressed as a monetary amount (with an allowance for future expense inflation) per new contract issued or per contract in force, as appropriate.

### Fixed amount per claim or percentage of claim amount

The treatment of claims expenses differs by the type of business.

In general, for claims that depend on death or survival of lives, the claim expense is often likely to be independent of claim size and expressed as an amount per claim.

For general insurance business, the expenditure on claims administration will be proportionate to the size of claim, with small claims being accepted (especially if there is the loss of a no claims discount) with minimal evidence, larger claims requiring assessment of multiple estimates, and the largest claims involving appointment of firms of loss adjusters.

Therefore for life insurance business, claim (or termination) expenses are typically allowed for through a fixed expense loading per claim (allowing for inflation). For general insurance business, claims expense loadings are often expressed as a percentage of the claim amount.
