## Principles of investment

Provider should select investments that are appropriate to the
**NTTCCA** of liabs plus the provider's appetite for risk.

## Liability cashflows

Actual liability outgo in any year, or month, depends on;

- Monetary value of each of the constituents and
- Probability of it being received or paid out.

Liability outgo may be split by nature into four categories;

1. Guaranteed in money terms
1. Guaranteed in terms of a prices index or similar
1. Discretionary
1. Investment-linked

## Mismatching

Free assets or a surplus means that the provider can depart from the matching
strategies so as to improve the overall return on its assets and benefit its;

- Clients, through higher benefits, or lower premium / contribution rates
- Shareholders (if any), through higher dividends

## Regulation

The following controls affecting investment strategy may be implemented;

- Restrictions on type of assets held
- Restrictions on amount of any particular type of asset that can be taken into
account for demonstrating solvency
- A requirement to match assets and liabilities by currency
- Restrictions on the maximum exposure to a single counterparty
- Custodianship of assets
- Requirement to hold a certain proportion of total assets in a particular class
- Requirement to hold a mismatching reserve
- A limit on the extent to which mismatching is allowed.

## Pure matching

Structuring the flow of income and maturity proceeds from the assets so they
coincide precisely with the net outgo from the liabilities under all
circumstances.

## Liability hedging

Assets are chosen in such a way as to perform in the same way as the
liabilities.

## Asset-liability models

An appropriate model set up to project the asset proceeds and liability outgo
into the future can be used to set an investment strategy to control the risk
of failing to meet the objectives.

ALMs can either be deterministic of stochastic.
