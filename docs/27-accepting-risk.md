## Risk appetite and risk efficiency

Different stakeholders will have different risk appetites.

Risk appetite will also vary within a class of stakeholders, e.g.
dependent on features of a particular individual or company.

Appetite may be related to

- Existing exposure to risk
- Culture of the individual / company

Sufficient capital is needed if a risk is to be retained.
Individuals rarely have sufficient capital to absorb the consequences of a
risk event occurring.

The fact that different stakeholders have different appetites for risk
enables risk to be transferred between different entities in exchange
for a monetary payment.

Where there is a good market for risk transfer,
the system is said to be risk efficient.

## Risk and product design

Insurance products are prime examples of a means by which one party transfers
risk to another party, for a cash payment which needs to cover the cost of the
risk plus profit.

Collective investment schemes allow individuals to transfer the risk of making
poor investment decisions due to lack of expertise or lack of time to perform
research.

All risks involved in a product should be identified during the product design
process, and mitigation techniques considered.
It may be possible to hedge risks across different product types
(e.g. immediate annuities and whole life assurances).

To deteremine an appropriate cost for a particular policy,
risks should be classified into subgroups, each of which represents a
homogenous body of risk with a particular set of rating factors.

There is a risk that a product design will not meet beneficiaries' needs and
desires.
This can be addressed through market research and trials.

Additional options may make a product more attractive, but also introduce new
risks and therefore additional cost.

## Insurable risk

- Policyholder has an interest in the risk
- Risk is of a financial and reasonably quantifiable nature
- Claim amount payable has some relationship to the financial loss

Additional criteria

- Individual risks should be independent
- Probability of risk occurring should be relatively small
- Large numbers of risks should be pooled to reduce variance
- There should be a limit on ultimate liability undertaken
- Moral hazard should be eliminated as far as possible
- There should be sufficient existing data / information to quantify the risk

## Pooling risk

Insureres and reinsurers take on risks in return for a premium because in doing
so they can combine or pool many risks together.

This means that te law of large numbers takes effect, which implies that actual
results are increasingly likely to be close to expected results, which results
in greater certainty (lower volatility) for the insurer.

Through the assessment and control of risk, actuaries create opportunities for
insurance companies to make profit by accepting risk.
