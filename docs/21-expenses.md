[2018 April Paper 2 Q3](40-2018-04-02.md#3)

Expenses can be split between
fixed and variable, and
direct and indirect.

Fixed expenses are constant in the short term.
Variable expenses vary by the amount of business handled.
Some expenses fall between these two,
such as management costs,
and remain constant apart from large changes from time to time.

Direct expenses can be identified as belonging to a particular class or
classes of business while indirect expenses cannot.

## Expense allocation

Expense allocations take place for

- Pricing
- Provisioning
- Profitability investigations (e.g. analysis of surplus)
- Financial planning

Premiums and provisions should be adequate to cover

- Administration costs
- Claims handling costs
- Fixed expenses
- Expected claims or benefits

Expense loading could be expressed as

- Percentage of premium (commission) or sum-assured (underwriting)
- Percentage of funds under management (investment expenses)
- Fixed amount per contract (administration cost)
- Fixed amount per claim (termination expense) or percentage of claim
(claim expense)
- Combination of the above

## Adjustments to pricing expense loadings

- Cross-subsidies
- Inflation
- Competition

Expenses need to be allocated by class and function.

### Allocation to class

Direct expenses are often allocated using timesheets.

Indirect expenses may be allocated by

- Floor space
- Charge out (e.g. computing expense)
- In proportion with other expenses

### Allocation to function

Non-commission expenses can be split into

- Initial expenses
- Maintenance expenses
    - Renewal
    - Investment
- Termination

Function allocation helps to determine which expenses are charged to
which contracts e.g.
regular vs single premium or paid-up policies.
