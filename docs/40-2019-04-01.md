### 2-i.

*Describe the Minimum Capital Requirement and the Solvency Capital Requirement under the Solvency II regime.*

The minimum captial requirement (MCR) is the threshold at which firms can no longer trade.

The solvency capital requirement (SCR) is the target level of capital below which firms need to discuss remedies with the regulator.

Remedies may include no longer writing new business.

### 2-ii.

*Explain why an insurance company might use an internal model to assess its regulatory capital requirements.*

The alternative to an internal model is the standard model provided by the regulator.

The standard model is designed to model the capital requirements for an average firm.

An internal models aim to create a stochastic model that reflects a company's business structure.

This is advantageous because the insurance company can

- Calculate economic capital using different risk measures e.g. VaR and Tail VaR
- Calculate levels of confidence in the level of economic capital
- Apply different time horizons to the assessment of solvency and risk
- Include risk classes not included in the standard model
- More confidently use the model outputs for management decisions as the model reflects the individual firm's business more accurately.

If the standard model does not reflect the insurance firm's business, they may end up eroneously entering into remedial conversations with the regulator ...

... if the standard model suggests a higher level of capital than the risks in the business truly require ...

... which an internal model would have captured.

- confirmation from airlines re delays ...
- ... or third party confirmation e.g. skyscanner

#### Diversification
