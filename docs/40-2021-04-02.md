*An insurance company (LifeCo) in a developed country with a high level of financial regulation is considering selling a new product providing long-term care benefits for individual citizens. LifeCo currently sells whole of life assurance and annuity products.*

*In recent years, the country's citizens have benefitted from significant improvements in life expectancy. Over the same period, there have been significant restrictions on government spending. This has led to the government reducing its financial support for meeting the costs of long-term care for its citizens. The government has indicated that it plans to cut its funding of long-term care further in future years.*

*In response to the government's proposed changes in long-term care funding, LifeCo intends launching a new long-term care product, which will be sold to people in employment. The product will offer a range of benefits that can be chosen by the individual. The benefits offered on the product may include:*

- *provision of nursing care in the policyholder's own home*
- *cash payments to cover residential care*
- *placements at purpose-built care homes, with different levels of care available depending on need*
- *cover for funeral costs.*

*Competition for this type of product is currently very low, with few competitors in the market. However, due to the reduction in government financial support for long-term care, a number of banks are also considering entering this market and offering each of the individual benefits listed above to their customers as standalone products.*

### 1-i

### 1-iii

*Describe the roles that the regulatory authorities may have in respect of the launch and ongoing management of LifeCo’s new product. [5]*

Functions of a regulator

- Influencing and reviewing government policy
- Vetting and registering firms and individuals authorised to conduct business
- Supervising the prudential management of financial organisations
- Enforcing regulations
- Providing information to consumers and the public

Areas addressed by regulation

- Information asymmetry
    - Occur when one party has relevant information and another party does not
    - Can lead to anti-selection
    - Asymmetries are exacerbated by the complex and long-term nature of financial products
    - Mitigation tools include
    - Disclosure of information in plain language
    - Chinese walls
    - Cooling off periods
    - Whistle blowing
- Maintain confidence
    - Danger that problems in one area of the financial system spread
    - Mitigation tools include
    - Checks on capital adequacy of providers
    - Ensuring practitioners are competent and act with integrity
    - Industry compensation schemes
    - Ensuring orderly and transparent markets
    - Stock exchange requirements

### 1-iv

*Discuss the risks that LifeCo faces from other parties that could affect the success of LifeCo's new product. [8]*

Parties

- competitors
    - lower prices
- reinsurers
    - default
- customers
    - demand
    - selection
- employees
    - expertise
    - misselling
- regulator
- investment managers
    - poor investment decisions

### 1-v

*Discuss how LifeCo could mitigate the risks identified in part (iv). [6]*

Risk management process

- Chief risk officer and risk manager
- for the new line of business.

Market research

Trainging employees

Management controls

- misselling training
- review of sales techniques
- e.g. record calls

Diversification

- of customers
- asset classes
- within asset classes
- of reinsurers

Reinsurance

- data on customers
- to help modelling of appropriate rating factors
- and so help to set premiums that reflect the level of risk

### 1-vi

*Discuss the level and cover of benefits that LifeCo could offer to policyholders who have stopped paying premiums. [4]*

Benefits capped at premiums paid in

No benefits

- contract could stipulate that cover ceases when benefits are no longer paid.
- reputational risk of being seen to cease cover for those in need
- risk this is not standard market practice and LifeCo loses business to competitors

Something inbetween

- LifeCo could still provide cover but at an amount lower than the benefits paid in
- helping to cover the cost of claims on policies that are not generating premiums

Regulation may stipulate this given regulation is tight in the country

and so LifeCo will have to provide the level and cover of benefits that regulation states.

### 1-vii

*Outline the assumptions LifeCo would need to set for pricing this product. [6]*

- medical inflation to project the cost of care
- price inflation to help project the cost of care e.g. salaries
- investment returns to help project cashflows used to pay benefits
- mortality rate
- lapses rate
- product mix - to properly account for any diversification benefits in the overall risk budget
- discount rate to find the present value of projected future cashflows
- rating factors and data availability / probability customers will want to provide this data
    - cannot assume this information will be available at the time the policy is underwritten even if it is available in a historical dataset LifeCo may have acquired
- frequency of premium payments
- interest rates on any debt used to finance the product
- cost of capital

*The government maintains and operates the railway system for the whole of a developed country. The government is responsible for ensuring that trains run on time and ticket prices provide customers with value for money. The train system is critical for most customers who commute to work in the main cities in the country.*

*The government has the following policies for refunding customers if a train journey is delayed or cancelled:*

- *15–29 minutes late = 20% of the customer's ticket price refunded*
- *30–59 minutes late = 40% of the customer's ticket price refunded*
- *60+ minutes late or train cancelled = 100% of the customer's ticket price refunded.*

*The government also maintains the roads in the country and has introduced a new traffic charge for the country’s six largest cities. The traffic charge is applied to vehicles entering or moving within each city traffic charging zone between 8 am and 10 am and between 4 pm and 7 pm on weekdays (excluding national holidays).*

*The traffic charge is inflation-linked, increasing each year. The government expects to keep the traffic charge and inflation-link policy in place for at least the next ten years.*

*The introduction of the new traffic charge has not been popular with citizens. Due to the poor punctuality of the train service, the introduction of the traffic charge has had a minimal impact on the number of vehicles entering the six largest cities.*

*The government is planning to outsource the maintenance of the railways to an overseas company, with the expectation that this will significantly improve the reliability and punctuality of trains. In addition, the government is evaluating the following package of proposals:*

*Action 1*

*To insure the risk of the train services being delayed / cancelled: in return for a premium, an insurance company would pay the necessary refunds on tickets.*

*Action 2*

*To sell the future rights to the traffic charge income to a pension scheme: in return for a one-off payment, the pension scheme would receive all future income from the traffic charge. The government is willing to split the rights into individual cities if more than one pension scheme is willing to invest. The rights would be sold using a bidding system to maximise the price.*

### 2-i

*Outline the risks of Action 1 from an insurance company’s viewpoint. [5]*

- Premium too low to cover the refunds paid and the insurer loses money
- Actual refunds greater than expected



### 2-ii

*Discuss the data an insurance company would need in order to price the contract under Action 1, including commenting on the limitations of the data. [10]*

Particular data points may include;

- total numbers of trains
- numbers of late trains
- numbers of passengers
- characteristics of passengers that may indicate likelihood of claiming a refund
- price of tickets

Consideration that past may not be representative of the future.

Sources of data.

The insurance company will want both historic and expected future data.

Given the change in management and the introduction of the congestion charge.

A sufficient volume of data is required for these data.

In particular, a volume that allows the data to be split into homogeneous groups.

Data will need to be collected over a sufficiently long time to be able to tell if there are any trends in the data.

The insurance company should consider if the data need to be seasonally adjusted.

- for example, there may be more people using trains in the winter.

Need to consider whether the data is complete and whether and how to check for errors.

Projections of expected deplays and cancelations under the new management.

- Government may be able to share these as part of any analysis they did when choosing the overseas manager.
- Otherwise the insurance company will need data to create these projections themselves.

Projections of expected numbers of passengers should the trains become prompt enough to entice the public to use them ...

... particularly with the new congestion charge.

- Government may be able to share these as part of any analysis they did when choosing to implement the congestion charge.
- Otherwise the insurance company will need data to create these projections themselves.

Passenger characteristics collected that may indicate likelihood of claiming a refund may be subject to data protection laws such as GDPR.

The insurance company should consider whether the additional insights gained from the data are worth the additional risks.

### 2-iii

*Discuss the factors an insurance company would need to consider (other than the availability of data) when pricing the policy in Action 1. [12]*
