## Interpreting accounts

Accounting rules, guidance, and practice in the country concerned.
These may well be unfamiliar to the domestic insurer and would make comparisons difficult.

It may well be difficult to get a clear picture of the above factors due to the level of detail provided in the accounts.

The company is small, so the results may be quite volatile.

The position in the insurance cycle should be considered, since this can have a significant impact on profitability.

The basis used to value the liabilities should be considered.

This is difficult to determine from the accounts and will depend on

- the internal model / assumptions used
- the management’s risk appetite
 -any actuarial judgement etc.

The basis used to value the assets should be considered.

- how does it treat realised and unrealised capital gains / losses?
- whether assets are valued at market value or by some other method
- if assets are valued at market value, they are likely to be quite volatile so current market conditions should be considered.

The accounts may be distorted by exceptional events, such as

- large / catastrophic losses
- a redundancy exercise
- mergers / acquisitions
- exceptional expenditure e.g. IT development etc.

The accounts in isolation do not give a clear picture of the condition of an insurer – trends over time are more important.

However, such trends can be difficult to analyse because changes in the reserving basis might mean that year-on-year results are not consistent.

The accounts should be compared to relevant competitors if possible
- based in the same country and subject to the same accounting rules
- writing similar classes and mix of business
- using similar levels of reinsurance

## Reports accompanying accounts

Reports accompanying accounts expand the information available about the
company.
What is _not_ said or included can also be insightful.

Additional reports might include

- Chairperson's and CEO's statements - successes, progress against key
objectives, senior management changes
- Investment report
- Strategic report
- Risk report
- Renumeration report
- Corporate governance report
