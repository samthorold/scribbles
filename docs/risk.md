## Risk management tools

- **Management controls**
    - data recording
        - good quality data can help to reduce operational risks
    - accounting and auditing
        - effective acct and auditing cannot change the risks accepted
        - but enables proper provisions to be established
    - monitoring of liabilities
        - help protect against unacceptably high aggregations of risk
        - and help check that business mix is as expected
    - options and guarantees.
        - experience of such opts and guars can be fed back into pricing and underwr

- **Underwriting at the proposal stage** and **claims controls**
    - reasons for underwriting
        - helps to reduce anti-selection
        - identify risks for which special terms need to be quoted
        - or which need to be declined.
        - helps bring claim experience closer to that assumed when pricing
        - classify risks into homogeneous groups for which a standard premium can be charged
    - purpose of claims controls
        - cost of claims controls must be proportional to its benefit
        - tight policy wording
- Reinsurance
- **Diversification**
    - how to achieve
    - different lines of business
        - age group
        - policy type e.g. comprehensive and 3rd party
        - gender

## Risks

[Risk identification - risk categories](25-risk-identification-and-classification.md#risk-categories)

Ideas

- practicalities
- economic environment
- expertise
- operational
- tax
- regulation
- underlying asset
- natural disasters
    - location
- [stakeholders](environment.md#stakeholders)

### Financial products

#### Credit

- poor financial strength of [x]
- deterioration in credit rating
- lack of diversification
- time to recovery
- recovery not 100% of value
- other actions that increase security / return increase chance of default

#### Market

- value of [x] high / low relative to [collateral]
- interest rates
    - fixed investments no longer earn attractive return
- low rents
- x doesn't increase as expected
- economic risks
    - interest rate risk - PV of cashflows - value of underlying asset
    - lending req's become more stringent

#### Liquidity

- difficult to realise investment - because [x]
- may need to sell below market price to accelerate sale
- timing of cashflows all near the end of the term of the contract

#### Business

- CALL ST if underlying asset is property
- longevity
- mortality
- early repayment

#### Operational

- poorly drafted contract
- fraud
- poor management of data and the underwriting process
- accused of mis-selling the product e.g. if high pressure selling techniques are used



#### External

- [CREATE GRAND LISTS](environment.md) - changes in each.
- [Regulation](03-regulation.md) - changes in.
- competitors offer a more attractive product.
