## Parties involved

- the providers
- the providers' customers
- actuaries
- lawyers
- accountants
- financial backers
- administrators

The providers and their customers will want financial structures that meet their needs in a cost-effective manner.

The provider's needs will be influenced by;

- the chosen market
    - demographic and economic composition of the customers
        - age
        - gender
        - wealth
    - legislation
    - taxation
    - accountancy standards
    - assets available - investment and risk characteristics
    - State provision of benefits
competition from other financial services providers
- the capital available
- the expertise available.

The provider's customers' needs will be influenced by;

- capacity to pay
- the risks to be covered
- the benefits that are needed at different times in the future
- attitude to financial risk.

### Actuaries

Actuaries will be involved in the initial costing of the financial structures and the subsequent determination of the provisions that will need to be held to meet future liabilities.

They will also be involved in the ongoing design process through assessing the impact on both the cost and the provisioning implications of modifications to the benefit design.

In both life and general insurance, the task of the initial costing of financial contracts is known as pricing or rating.

The subsequent determination of how much money to hold back to meet future liabilities is known as provisioning or reserving.

For defined benefit pension schemes, the initial costing refers to determining an appropriate initial level of contributions.

Subsequent determination of the provisions that will need to be held to meet future liabilities will be done as part of the funding valuation.

### Lawyers

Lawyers will be involved in the drafting of the contracts supporting the financial structures to ensure that the provider is not exposed to the risk of providing more benefits or entering into greater risks than intended.

### Accountants

Accountants will be involved in ensuring that the provider of the financial structures properly accounts for the income and outgo.

### Financial backers

The financial backers will want regular reports demonstrating proper stewardship of the finance provided.

### Administrators

Administrators will need to administer the financial structures.

The more complex the financial structures are, the greater the cost of administration.

This should be reflected in the amounts paid by the customers.

In addition, the more complex the structure, the greater the risk of error, i.e. of operational risk.

Therefore, costs might arise from complexity both in terms of administration time and error correction.

### Sales and marketing

Sales people need training on the financial structures.

The more complex the financial structures are, the greater the cost of training and the harder the contracts may be to sell.

Marketing teams can provide important information on the characteristics of the target market as part of the design process.

## Risk appetite - risk aversion

It is important that the financial structure as designed meets the risk profile of the intended customer, and that the risks involved in the product are clearly explained to the customer.

The different risk appetites of different stakeholders were covered in [Chapter 4](04-financial-products-and-customer-need.md).

Sales of a financial product will be optimised if the product can be designed to be suitable for customers with a wide range of risk appetites.

For savings products, whether insurance contracts or benefit schemes, this can be achieved by offering a range of investment choices.

Having a range of funds available means that the contract can allow for any change in the customer’s risk appetite during the term of the policy.


## Regulation

It is essential that the design of a financial product is consistent with any legal or regulatory requirements that apply to the provider or to the particular type of product.

For example, in most developed countries motor vehicle insurance must include third party liability cover.

Where such requirements exist they will also stipulate a minimum level of cover that must be provided.

Legislation or regulation may provide a more attractive financial or taxation regime if the policy meets certain conditions.

For example, there may be tax advantages that apply to a life insurance product as long as the sum assured on death is a minimum of a specified multiple of the premiums paid.

A government might impose this to ensure that products provide a minimum level of protection cover and are not just savings plans.

Where these regimes are optional, the provider needs to decide whether the contract will be designed to be inside or outside the regime.

In either case the position needs to be made clear to the customer at the point of sale to avoid misleading them.

Many regulatory regimes impose a "cooling-off period" for financial products where the customer can cancel and get a full refund within an initial period, perhaps 14 days.

For policies that are cancelled in this way, the provider will have incurred initial set up expenses and will make a loss on the policy.

It is important that such expenses are recouped.

The normal way of doing this is to set initial charges by dividing the total expenses of the new business operation, including dealing with policy cancellations, by the number of policies that go into force, i.e. are not cancelled.

This results in policies which do continue covering the costs of those that are cancelled in the cooling-off period.

In some countries there may be requirements on providers to present certain information to potential customers.

This may include illustrations of discontinuance terms.

If these disclosures are thought to be a feature of a customer's decision to take the policy then the provider may wish to show attractive figures.

Such illustrations must then be borne in mind when actually determining the surrender value.

Although the company is not offering a guarantee, it could be embarrassing for the company if discontinuance terms quoted in its literature (or in the financial press) conflicted with figures actually quoted to policyholders.

Disclosure requirements may also set out the discontinuance basis to be used and hence influence the extent to which policies terminating later, or remaining to maturity, subsidise the benefits offered on short duration discontinuance.


## Profitability

There are a number of commercial considerations associated with the design of a contract.

These include;

- profitability
- marketability
- competitiveness

Profitability is a key issue in designing insurance contracts.

In a proprietary company, there may be a minimum profit (or return on capital) target that each product needs to meet.

Therefore premium rates (or charges, where relevant) would need to be set in order to meet expected claims, expenses and the target level of profit.

The important variables that might impinge on the profitability of an insurance contract are;

- claims experience (including mortality and morbidity experience)
    - claims frequency
    - claims severity (i.e. claim amount)
    - claims inflation
    - options and guarantees
- expenses and expense inflation
- investment returns
- withdrawal experience
- new business sales volumes and mix

## The market for the product

The intended target market will affect the design of a financial product.

The design will need to be attractive to the target market and appropriate for the sales method.

Characteristics improving marketability include;

- having innovative design features such as options and guarantees
- simplicity - easy to understand
- transparency - good disclosure of information to the customer
- low charges

Products directed at lower income individuals are likely to be simple contracts with a clear insured event.

Such simplicity reduces cost and the product is more likely to be affordable and comprehensible to the target market.

At the other extreme, high net worth individuals are likely to favour flexible products that can be adjusted as their financial circumstances change.

The provision of options and guarantees is likely to be attractive to this group.

These features add cost, but the target market would normally understand the cost of flexibility and guarantees and be prepared to pay it.

The same applies when products are being designed for advisers to sell to their customers - it is the needs of the advisers’ customers that should be considered.

## Competitive pressures

- price
- product featutes

### Price

[Chapter 23](23-pricing-and-finance.md)

### Product features

Other products cannot be directly compared on price and instead the risks covered, the administrative systems and the claims process all feature in the customer's decision.

For example, motor breakdown cover may or may not cover breakdown at the driver's home, may provide a guarantee of attending a claim within a specified time, may offer different options if the vehicle cannot be repaired at the roadside.

All these items feature in the decision to purchase as well as the price.

There is a risk to a provider of offering terms that are very different from the rest of the market.

Customers may assume that the terms are consistent with the rest of the market and be disappointed if they don't receive what they expect, even if they receive the benefits specified by the policy.

A provider who offers different terms from the market may attract selective business (this is covered in [Chapter 20](20-mortality-and-morbidity.md)) which means that the product mix is not as expected.

However, differentiation can be a positive sales point, as it can offset a less price competitive product.

The idea of selective business is illustrated by the following real-life example.

In some cases being different from the market can force the market to catch up with the innovators.

Because there are more non-smokers than smokers in the UK, the first provider to offer lower life assurance premium rates for non-smokers (and higher rates for smokers) than the rest of the market secured a lot of business.

Providers that did not discriminate attracted smokers who benefited from a mixed aggregate premium rate, and therefore those providers' mortality experience was worse than expected.

This soon forced the whole market to change to differentiating by smoking status.

How competitive a product is will also depend upon how the product is sold.

For example, selling through independent intermediaries tends to result in more competitive pricing than selling through an insurance company's own sales force.

This is because the former seek out the best contract terms for their customers from across the market, whereas the latter only sell contracts from that particular insurance company.

The desire to be competitive often conflicts with the profitability of the design.

## Making disclosure more or less simple
