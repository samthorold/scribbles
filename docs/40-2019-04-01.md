*List four key stakeholders in the risk governance of a life insurance company.*

- Chief risk officer
- Risk owners
- Employees
- Shareholders

### 1-ii.

*Describe how each of the stakeholders in part (i) could contribute to the risk governance of the company.*

Shareholders

- Set risk budget for company.
- Assess periodic risk reporting from chief risk officer.

Chief risk officer

- Responsible for life insurer as a whole staying within risk budget set by shareholders
- Allocates risk budget to the risk owners ...
- ... taking into account diversification benefits.

Risk owners

- Use their part of the risk budget set by chief risk officer ...
- ... to create value for the firm within their business unit.

Employees

- All employees have an important role in risk governance of the firm.
- For example, alerting management to potentially risky activities.

## 2.

### 2-i.

*Describe the Minimum Capital Requirement and the Solvency Capital Requirement under the Solvency II regime.*

The minimum captial requirement (MCR) is the threshold at which firms can no longer trade.

The solvency capital requirement (SCR) is the target level of capital below which firms need to discuss remedies with the regulator.

Remedies may include no longer writing new business.

### 2-ii.

*Explain why an insurance company might use an internal model to assess its regulatory capital requirements.*

The alternative to an internal model is the standard model provided by the regulator.

The standard model is designed to model the capital requirements for an average firm.

An internal models aim to create a stochastic model that reflects a company's business structure.

This is advantageous because the insurance company can

- Calculate economic capital using different risk measures e.g. VaR and Tail VaR
- Calculate levels of confidence in the level of economic capital
- Apply different time horizons to the assessment of solvency and risk
- Include risk classes not included in the standard model
- More confidently use the model outputs for management decisions as the model reflects the individual firm's business more accurately.

If the standard model does not reflect the insurance firm's business, they may end up eroneously entering into remedial conversations with the regulator ...

... if the standard model suggests a higher level of capital than the risks in the business truly require ...

... which an internal model would have captured.

*Over the last five years in a particular country, the government has been reducing the amount of State healthcare it provides, while the population size has remained unchanged.*

*An insurance company operating in that country sells a variety of domestic products and is considering the implications of the healthcare reductions for its pricing assumptions.*

*Discuss the implications for the pricing assumptions of each of the company’s products sold in that country:*

Lower state healthcare

- higher mortality and morbidity
    - shorter lifespans
    - less premiums
- higher demand for private healthcare

### 3-a.

### 3-c.

### 4.

*A general insurance company offers a worldwide travel insurance policy that provides coverage against the following risks:*

- *medical cover required whilst in a foreign country*
- *loss of luggage whilst travelling*
- *flight delays of more than three hours.*

*Describe tools that the insurance company can use to aid the management and control of the above risks.*

#### Management controls

#### Underwriting at the proposal stage

The firm can make sure to use underwriting at the proposal stage to make sure risks are rated appropriately

- Preexisting medical conditions ...
- ... particularly those related to flying / changes in air pressure.
- Confirm which countries the policy holder plans to travel to ...
- ... in particular those countries with high traffic accidents.

#### Claims controls

The firm can use claims controls to limit the claims frequency and severity ...

... particularly reducing fraudulent claims.

E.g.

- Require doctors notes for medical claims ...
- ... in the native language of the insurer.
- receipts proving value of luggage
- confirmation from airlines re delays ...
- ... or third party confirmation e.g. skyscanner

#### Diversification

- countries of travel ...
- ... or at least medical regime e.g. EU health card accepting countries
- countries of stopover ...
- ... even if a traveller isn't stopping in a country ...
- ... the country may be more likely to lose luggage

#### ART

- catastrophe bonds ...
- ... travel losses may be high in hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.

#### Reinsurance

    - verifying claim value

### 6.

#### 6-i.

*State what is meant by a ‘best estimate’ assumption.*

There is equal probability that the assumption over-estimates or under-estimates the output.

#### 6-ii.

*Give two examples where a ‘best estimate’ assumption would be suitable.*

Management decisions e.g. allocating the overall risk budget to risk owners / departments

Internal accounts

#### 6-v.

*Suggest why a regulatory regime may not recognise equalisation reserves.*


## 7.

*A retirement benefits scheme in Country A (‘the Scheme’) currently has all of its funds invested in domestic, as opposed to overseas, assets. The Scheme’s managers are reviewing the fixed-interest bonds currently held. They propose to invest a portion of the Scheme’s assets in government bonds issued in Country B, which currently have a lower redemption yield than comparable bonds of Country A.*

### 7-i.

*Suggest possible reasons for the Scheme managers’ proposal.*

### 7-ii.

*Discuss factors which the Scheme’s managers would need to take into account if the proposal were to be accepted.*

- return

- regulation

- advised to do so

*Discuss, in each of the following separate cases, the expected differences in the level of mortality:*
