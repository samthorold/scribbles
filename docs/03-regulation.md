## Role of major financial institutions

Major financial institutions support the regulatory framework

- Central bank: controls or influences economic variables and is a lender of
last resort
- State intervention: provide products and control premium rates
- Larger market participants:
    - influence rates
    - allow smaller participants to find niche markets
    - but, may distort the  market and use up too much of the regulator's
    resources
